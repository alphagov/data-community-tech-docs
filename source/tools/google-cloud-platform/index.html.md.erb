# Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services.
GDS maintains a central account for use across GDS.

The pages in this section contain information on:

- [how to get access to and use GCP](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-access)
- [how to use BigQuery](/tools/google-cloud-platform/bigquery)

Logs data on the use of many GCP resources is captured and stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets.
More information on this data can be found on the [GCP logs data source page](/data-sources/gcp-logs/).

## Governance 

GCP is certified as [ISO/IEC 27001:2022 compliant](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/iso-27001).

In many cases (such as with the collection and use of [Google Analytics data](/data-sources/ga/ga4/)), the storage and usage of data within GCP is governed by Data Protection Impact Assessments.

### Projects

Projects should have logging set up (and ideally routed to the [`all_gcp_logs` dataset](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/data-sources/gcp-logs/)), quotas applied, and terraformed permissions.

Projects should also have key roles (owner and editor) assigned to Google groups rather than individuals.

Key projects and the quotas applied to them are listed below.

| Project name | Project ID and link | Purpose | Quotas | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GA4 analytics | [ga4-analytics-352613](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=ga4-analytics-352613) | To store [GOV.UK GA4](/data-sources/ga/ga4-bq/) and [Search Console](/data-sources/gsc/) data | 1TB per user per day and a global limit of 3.5TB per day |  |
| Universal analytics | [govuk-bigquery-analytics](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=govuk-bigquery-analytics) | For all work around the collection and use of GOV.UK Universal Analytics data | 2TB per user per day and a global limit of 3TB per day | This project should not be heavily used now that GOV.UK has migrated to GA4 |
| GDS BigQuery reporting | [gds-bq-reporting](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=gds-bq-reporting) | To enable querying of our GA4 data in various reporting tools while monitoring costs and access | Global limit of 15TB per day |  |
| GDS BigQuery data | [gds-bq-data](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=gds-bq-data) | To store data for use in various reporting tools while monitoring costs and access | 1TB per user per day and a global limit of 3TB per day |  |
| GDS BigQuery processing | [gds-bq-processing](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=gds-bq-processing) | To enable the programmatic processing of datasets while monitoring costs and access, keeping processing queries separate from reporting queries | Global limit |  |
| GDS GA Archive | [gds-ga-archive](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=gds-ga-archive) | To store historic Universal Analytics data from properties managed by GDS | None |  |
| GOV.UK App Production | [govuk-app-production](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=govuk-app-production) | To store and process [GOV.UK App GA4](/data-sources/ga/app-ga4-bq/) data |  |  |
