# Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services.
GDS maintains a central account for use across GDS.

The pages in this section contain information on:

- [how to get access to and use GCP](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-access)
- [how to use BigQuery](/tools/google-cloud-platform/bigquery)

Logs data on the use of many GCP resources is captured and stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets.
More information on this data can be found on the [GCP logs data source page](/data-sources/gcp-logs/).

## Governance 

GCP is certified as [ISO/IEC 27001:2022 compliant](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/iso-27001).

In many cases (such as with the collection and use of [Google Analytics data](/data-sources/ga/ga4/)), the storage and usage of data within GCP is governed by Data Protection Impact Assessments.

### Projects

Projects should have logging set up (and ideally routed to the [`all_gcp_logs` dataset](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/data-sources/gcp-logs/)), quotas applied, and terraformed permissions.

Key projects and the quotas applied to them are listed below.

| Project name | Project ID and link | Purpose | Quotas | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GA4 analytics | [ga4-analytics-352613](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=ga4-analytics-352613) | To store [GOV.UK GA4](/data-sources/ga/ga4-bq/) and [Search Console](/data-sources/gsc/) data | 1TB per user per day and a global limit of 3.5TB per day |  |
| Universal analytics | [govuk-bigquery-analytics](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=govuk-bigquery-analytics) | For all work around the collection and use of GOV.UK Universal Analytics data | Global limit of 3TB per day | This project should not be heavily used now that GOV.UK has migrated to GA4 |
| GDS BigQuery reporting | [gds-bq-reporting](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=gds-bq-reporting) | To enable querying of our GA4 data in various reporting tools while monitoring costs and access | Global limit of 15TB per day |  |
| GDS BigQuery data | [gds-bq-data](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=gds-bq-data) | To store data for use in various reporting tools while monitoring costs and access | 1TB per user per day and a global limit of 3TB per day |  |
| GDS GA Archive | [gds-ga-archive](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=gds-ga-archive) | To store historic Universal Analytics data from properties managed by GDS | None |  |
