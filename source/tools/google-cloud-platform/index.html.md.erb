# Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services. GDS maintains a central account.

This section contains information on:

- [how to get access to and use GCP](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-access)
- [details of certain key GCP projects](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-projects)
- [how to use BigQuery](/tools/google-cloud-platform/bigquery)

Logs data on the use of many GCP resources is captured and stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets.
More information on this data can be found on the [GCP logs data source page](/data-sources/gcp-logs/).
