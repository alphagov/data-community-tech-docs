# Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services.
GDS maintains a central account for use across GDS.

This section contains information on:

- [how to get access to and use GCP](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-access)
- [details of certain key GCP projects](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-projects)
- [how to use BigQuery](/tools/google-cloud-platform/bigquery)

Logs data on the use of many GCP resources is captured and stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets.
More information on this data can be found on the [GCP logs data source page](/data-sources/gcp-logs/).

## Governance 

GCP is certified as [ISO/IEC 27001:2022 compliant](https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/iso-27001).

In many cases (such as with the collection and use of [Google Analytics data](/data-sources/ga/ga4/)), the storage and usage of data within GCP is governed by Data Protection Impact Assessments.
