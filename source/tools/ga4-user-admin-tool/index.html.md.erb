# GA4 User Admin Tool
The GA4 User Admin tool is used to add and delete users' access to www.gov.uk production Google Analytics data.
The tool adds a user to [www.gov.uk GA4 production data](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) as well as providing read access to GA4 nested data, flattened data and www.gov.uk Search Console data stored in BigQuery.

The tool is located [here](https://34.36.39.60.nip.io/) and is deployed from the [GA4 Analytics project](/gcp).
To access the tool you will need to be signed into your GDS Google account and be a member of the Google Group 'ga-user-admin'.
The app uses [IAP](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/iap) to grant access.

The code, and issue management, can be found in the [ga4-user-admin Github repository](https://github.com/alphagov/ga4-user-admin).

## Adding a user
Users added via this tool will not be automatically notified by Google so it is important to still send any welcome messaging.
The standard message is located in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A7KLTPxxtTPsVK8zzm7B-UqdjTLYxL0ykRyai2Q_01Y/edit#heading=h.xxmc91ktkyr2).

## Issues and errors when adding a user
If you get an error in Marketing Platform stating that the user does not satisy the organisation's user policy this is related to not having associated their account with Google.
