# GA4 User Admin tool
The GA4 User Admin tool is used to grant and remove users' access to GA4 and BigQuery data.

Different variants of this tool are used to add users to different GA4 properties and BigQuery datasets.

## How to use the tool
### Accessing the tool
To access the tool(s) you will need to be signed into your GDS Google account and be a member of the 'ga-user-admin' Google Group.
The app uses [IAP](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/iap) to manage access.

### Adding a user
Users added via the User Admin tool will not be automatically notified by Google so it is important to still send any welcome messaging.
The standard message for GOV.UK users can be found on the [welcome message page](/processes/ga-access/welcome-message/).

## Issues and errors when adding a user
Sometimes the tool will fail to add a user.
This is most commonly because they do not have a Google account.
The user will need to [set up a Google account with their work email address](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en#existingemail) before they can be granted access to GA4 data.

If you continue to get errors when adding users, you can attempt to use Google Marketing Platform to add the user, and see what error message you receive in Marketing Platform.
If you see an error message in Marketing Platform stating that the user does not satisy the organisation's user policy, this is commonly related to the user not having associated their account with Google.
