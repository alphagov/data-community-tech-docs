## Adding a user
When adding a user via this tool they will not be automatically notified by Google, therefore it is important to still send any welcome messaging. The standard message is located in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A7KLTPxxtTPsVK8zzm7B-UqdjTLYxL0ykRyai2Q_01Y/edit#heading=h.xxmc91ktkyr2).

## Issues and errors when adding a user
If in the marketing platform you get an error that says the user does not satisy the organisations user policy then this is related to not having associated their account with Google.
