# Looker Studio

Looker Studio is a dashboarding tool from Google

## Report creation

When creating a new report, use one of the standard data connections listed [here](https://trello.com/c/N8C3H9KT/55-looker-studio-data-sources)

You should also add the Looker [GA4 property ID](https://trello.com/c/N8C3H9KT/55-looker-studio-data-sources) to the report to track usage.

## Data connections

Writing custom SQL with date range parameters is preferred if you are making a new data connection to a sharded table. This is because Looker queries all shards if connecting to the table directly.

You should turn off Community Visualisations.
