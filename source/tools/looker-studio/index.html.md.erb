# Looker Studio

Looker Studio is an online dashboarding tool, developed by Google.

Looker Studio is a key tool used within GDS for web analytics data visualisations and reporting.

There are two key concepts within Looker Studio; Reports and Data Connections.


## Looker Studio Reports

Teams own the Looker Studio Reports that they create. This includes updates, sharing. maintenance and decommissioning.

When creating a report it is best practice to add a Google Group as an editor. This is to prevent access to the report being lost in the event that the owner's Google Account becomes deleted or unavailable. The Google Group can either be the Performance Analyst Community (performance-analysts@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) or a specific group for your team.

If you are a member of GDS staff, please use one of the standard data connections listed [in Trello](https://trello.com/c/N8C3H9KT/55-looker-studio-data-sources) when creating a new report.
If your data source is not listed there, it may not have a standard data connection.
If that is the case, please follow the instructions on data connections below, or ask the Data Engineering community (at #data-engineering) for support.

Make sure to add the Looker Studio [GA4 property ID](https://trello.com/c/N8C3H9KT/55-looker-studio-data-sources) to your report to track usage.

### Sharing

Looker Studio reports allow access to our data, and if the data connection is linked to BigQuery then viewers will be executing queries.

**Do not make your reports 'unlisted' or 'public' to share them.**

GDS data users can either share your reports with anyone on the GDS email domain, or with specified individuals or Google groups.

## Data sources and connections

Data Connections are split into ones centrally managed and owned by the Insights and Analytics Team and those locally managed in teams.

Centrally managed connections should be favoured over creating your own connections. Reasons for creating your own could include using a specific data source not available, or the sensitive nature of a piece of work. The Insights and Analytics owns and manages the centralised data connections, contact the team for any updates, changes or new data sources.

### Creating new data connections

When creating a new data connection to be shared, you should:

- Turn off Community Visualisations
- Set the 'Data credentials' used to the viewer's
- Add the Google Group 'data-connection-editors@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk' as editor
- Share with the GDS domain as viewer so that others can use your connection

Community visualisations must be turned off because a DPIA has not been carried out on them to assess the potential risk of data loss.

#### Connecting to BigQuery

If you are connecting to a BigQuery dataset, it is better to connect using a custom SQL query with date range parameters than to connect to the table directly.
This is because some of our data is stored in sharded tables, and Looker Studio queries all shards when direct connections are established.
This intiial query can be quite costly given the size of our datasets.

For some data, we have now created partitioned tables which are more efficient to query than sharded tables.
For example, we have a partitioned [flattened table for GOV.UK GA4 data](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/). These can also be used in custom SQL queries to connect Looker Studio to BigQuery.

For SQL examples showing how to connect to both partitioned and sharded data sources with date parameters, please refer to our guidance on [Looker Studio best practice](/analysis/govuk-ga4/use-ga4/looker-studio/).

When setting up the connection, ensure you select the appropriate billing project. 
For most shared reports that will be [the GDS BQ reporting project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_FQUVLNA_TYYCvI9WIuI6mOdFJTNsykSWJcNlv6SPrU/edit#gid=608928265).
