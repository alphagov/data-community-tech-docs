# Troubleshooting GovGraph

This is a miscellany of common problems and how to investigate them.

## Outdated or empty BigQuery tables

If the web app gives unexpected results, then the tables in BigQuery might not
have been updated correctly.  Usually that means a table either hasn't been
updated at all within the last 24 hours, or it has been updated and is now
empty.  You can quickly check every table by querying a view called
`test.tables-metadata` by writing a query like `SELECT * FROM
test.tables-metadata;`. The table is checked automatically every hour, and if it
finds old or empty tables then an 'incident' is created, and an email is sent to
govgraph-developers@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.

## Source data glitch

Most of the data originates in GOV.UK as database backup files of the Publishing
API database (PostgreSQL) and the Content Store database (MongoDB).  Those files
are copied to a GCP bucket by the [govuk-s3-mirror][govuk-s3-mirror].  Check
that the files are the expected size (many gigabytes) by looking in the
[bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/govuk-s3-mirror_govuk-integration-database-backups?project=govuk-s3-mirror).

## Some of the tables work but others don't

It isn't always clear which table didn't update correctly, because when
one table fails, sometimes the code stops running altogether, so other tables
that hadn't been attempted yet are never attempted.  This is because the code
that updates the tables is orchestrated by makefiles `src/mongodb/Makefile` and
`src/postgres/Makefile`, and when a step in a makefile fails, subsequent steps
aren't attempted, even if they don't depend on the step that failed.  An
additional complication is that the makefiles are configured to run several
steps in parallel, so when one step fails, any other steps that are still
running will finish.

In this situation, it is best to consult the
[logs](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query?project=govuk-knowledge-graph).
Unfortunately, [not everything is in the
logs](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp/issues/263), so
sometimes it is necessary to manually run the data process, SSH into the machine
that's running it, and tail the logs there.  See the section on [running the data
pipelines manually](../deploying#manually).
