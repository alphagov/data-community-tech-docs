# GovSearch

GovSearch is a tool to help content designers find content on GOV.UK. It collects most of the content on www.gov.uk from multiple data sources and indexes it to provide an advanced search engine.


## Overview

* The frontend is available to users at [https://gov-search.service.gov.uk](https://gov-search.service.gov.uk). Users need to authenticate using their Google account for selected government domains (such as digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). In the future we will use GOV.UK Signon for authentication.

* The service is hosted on GCP, mainly within the govuk-knowledge-graph project. The staging and development environment are hosted in separate projects, `govuk-knowledge-graph-staging` and `govuk-knowledge-graph-dev`, respectively.

* The source code is on github, at [https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp](alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp) and [https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-search](alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-search)

### Data pipeline

Every day:

- New backups of the GOV.UK Content Store and the Publishing API become available in the [govuk-s3-mirror_govuk-integration-database-backups](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/govuk-s3-mirror_govuk-integration-database-backups;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false) Bucket, as a result of the [S3 Mirror copy process](/engineering/govuk-s3-mirror/).

- A GCP Workflow (defined in the govuk-knowledge-graph project) is triggered by the mirror's Pub/Sub topic and creates 2 virtual machines, one running MongoDB to recreate an instance of the content store, and one running Postgres to recreate an instance of the Publishing API.

- From those two databases, a process creates multiple CSV files

- From those CSV files, a process spins up a Neo4j instance and another creates tables in BigQuery that receives content from the CSV files

- At that point all the data is ready for the two frontends:

    - Neo4j: available at [https://govgraph.dev:7473/](https://govgraph.dev:7473/) (VPN required - only available 9 to 7)
    - GovSearch: available at [https://gov-search.service.gov.uk](https://gov-search.service.gov.uk). GovSearch is available 24/7 but might miss data while BigQuery tables are being deleted and repopulated daily.

While Gov Search is the normal way to use the service, the Neo4j frontend allows for more complex searches using the Cypher language.


## Hosting

GovGraph is hosted in the govuk-knowledge-graph google cloud project. It uses the following services:

- Load balancer (managing the domain names, external and internal, authorisation)
- Cloud run (to run the front-end)
- BigQuery (to hold the data)
- Cloud Storage, to store the CSV files
- Cloud compute to run the Neo4j, mongo and postgres VMs
- Workflow to define the data pipeline

The terraform configuration describes how each service is set up.

## Front-end

The user-facing application is hosted as a Cloud Run service. Its source code is in a separate repository (alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-search).

### Architecture

It consists of an API, which fetches the search results from BigQuery and a
single-page app (SPA), which takes user input, queries the API, and displays the
search results.

Both the APIs and the SPA are written in TypeScript. The API is an ExpressJS
server. The software architecture, as well as instructions on how to run/develop
it, are explained in the repository's README file.

### Authorisation

Currently, the application is behind Google's OAuth authorisation framework (this is provided by the "Identity-aware proxy" service. This means that users must authenticate using an email address from a domain managed by Google Workspace. The authorised domains are listed out in the terraform configuration. Onboarding a new department is just a matter of adding its domain to the list.

As of March 2023, the plan is to move to the GOV.UK Signon authorisation framework in order to make GovSearch available to anyone in Government.


### Hosting and deployment

The front-end runs as a Cloud Run service and is therefore run as a Docker container. The Dockerfile is in the repository. There is also a script to deploy it to production using `gcloud run deploy`. Deploying in the staging or dev environments is a matter of changing the `--project` command-line parameter in the script.


### Analytics

Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager are enabled for GovSearch.

## Networking

The Google Cloud project makes use of a load balancer that handles the networking configuration:

Domain names: we use `govgraph.dev` as our internal domain for the production environment, as well as `govgraphstaging.dev` and `govgraphdev.dev`. Those domains, as well as the TLS certificates are managed using Cloud Domains and the terraform configuration can be found in the `terraform`, `terraform-dev` and `terraform-staging` directories in the git repo. The public-facing production domain, `gov-search.service.gov.uk` is delegated from the team managing `service.gov.uk` and we manage the mapping to the service's public IP address.
