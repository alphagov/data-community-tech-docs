# Google Analytics

Google Analytics is the tool we use to collect data from users about how they use our digital products and services.

## Data sources

We have a number of Google Analytics data sources, some of which are detailed in the [Data sources section of this site](/data-sources/ga/).

## Google Analytics 360
360 is Google's premium or enterprise tier. GDS has an active 360 contract.

All GDS GA4 properties should be created at this tier.
This is to ensure data collected is covered by our 360 contract terms.

Google Analytics 360 also has a number of advantages over the free tier, providing higher limits on data collection, reporting, retention, and export to BigQuery.
More information on the differences between free Google Analytics and Google Analytics 360 can be found on Google's [support pages](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11202874).

If you have created a new GDS Google Analytics property and need to upgrade it to 360, please contact the Analytics team.
