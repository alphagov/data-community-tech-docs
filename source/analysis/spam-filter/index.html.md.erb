# Use the spam filter

The spam filter is a [binary classifier](https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/#:~:text=each%20in%20turn.-,Binary%20Classification,prediction%20(churn%20or%20not)) machine learning algorithm that classifies feedback data as spam or not spam.



Receives some data and identifies whether a piece of data is spam or not.

Use the train-test split

We start with a dataset of 40k rows of feedback data for training.

We manually labelled data as spam or not spam.

Once we had that, we used this as training data to teach the spam classifier algorithm what is spam or not.

We decided deriving features - spam or not spam.

After that, the classifier is able to use this data and features to learn what is spam or not, and add classifications to the data as appropriate.

The classifier gives us a probability of data being spam.

ML considers a variety of factors and can attach a probability of being spam or not to data.

It separates its prediction from the information weâ€™ve given it.

We give it a new dataset, and it then attaches the probabilities to this new dataset, based on the training dataset.

ML would be able to look at the balance of non ASCII to ASCII characters and we can attach a point at which this is suspect or not.
