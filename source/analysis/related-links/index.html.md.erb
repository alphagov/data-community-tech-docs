# How are GOV.UK related links generated?

GOV.UK related links are generated using a machine learning model. There is detailed documentation available in various places. The developer docs have a dedicated page which provides a [technical overview](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/related-links.html).

The Data Products team have also produced a transparency report which provides a [high level overview](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-data-labs-cabinet-office-related-links) of the model and how it works. It also points you to relevant resources like the [Github repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-related-links-recommender).
