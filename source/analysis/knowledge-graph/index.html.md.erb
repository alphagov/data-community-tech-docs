# Use the Knowledge Graph data
The Knowledge Graph dataset contains a number of tables which contain information on the content of the GOV.UK website.

More information on the tables themselves can be found on the [Knowledge Graph data source page](/data-sources/govgraph/).

## Get access to Knowledge Graph data

To get access to the Knowledge Graph data, please post in the #data-engineering Slack channel. 
 
## How to use the Knowledge Graph data

One view of the Knowledge Graph data can be accessed via the [GovGraph tool]().

The Knowledge Graph data can also be queried directly in [BigQuery](/tools/google-cloud-platform/bigquery/), or it can be used in various reporting or data visualisation tools.

Whether you query it directly in BigQuery or use the data in a reporting tool, you will need a Google Cloud Platform project with billing enabled through which you can query the data.
If you are GDS staff, please contact the #data-engineering community who will be able to provide you with a Google Cloud Platform billing project ID.
If you work for another public sector organisation, your department or organisation will have to provide you with this ID. 

### Sample queries 

Some sample queries can be found [in the project's GitHub documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp/blob/main/docs/how-to-write-queries.md#worked-examples).
