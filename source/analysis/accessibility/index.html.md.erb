# Use the GOV.UK accessibility report runner

Data Services helped GOV.UK by creating an accessibility reporting tool to identify the accessibility issues among the half a million pages published on GOV.UK,
 assessing the siteâ€™s compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).
  Then, we contributed to finding improvements to some of the problems identified using data processing techniques.

  History of the tool can be found in this [blog post](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2021/02/16/how-we-created-a-reporting-tool-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-gov-uk/) with technical detail
   and [how to run it found here](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/govuk-accessibility-reports.html). The Data Products team built this tooling and can be considered the owners of the tool.
