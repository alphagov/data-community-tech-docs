# GOV.UK Knowledge Graph intermediate data files

The following intermediate data files are used to build the Knowledge Graph instance.

## preprocessed_content_store_<DDMMYY>.csv.gz

A data set of most GOV.UK content pages with multiple attributes for each page.

This data set is made of Content Store data, but:

- excludes [document types that are blocked from the topic taxonomy](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/config/document_types_excluded_from_the_topic_taxonomy.yml)
- only retrieves data for documents with a `Locale` field of `English`
- only retrieves content items with a `Phase` field of `Live`

The `ContentStore` Python class, defined in [`src.data.extract_contect_store.py`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/src/data/extract_content_store.py) and instantiated in [`src.build_graph_data.py`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/src/build_graph_data.py) retrieves the relevant Content Store data and saves it to a [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html).

The [`build_knowledge_graph_data`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/build_knowledge_graph_data) script exports a copy of this dataframe as the `preprocessed_content_store_<DDMMYY>.csv.gz` file to the `govuk-data-infrastructure-integration/knowldge_graph/` subdirectory in the AWS S3 bucket.

The dataframe is also used to instantiate the [`CreateContentGraph` Python class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/src/data/create_graph.py), which then generates other intermediate data files which are components of the Knowledge Graph.

The `preprocessed_content_store_<DDMMYY>.csv.gz` file has the following data fields.
