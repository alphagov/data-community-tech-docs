# Use GOV.UK Knowledge Graph

The [GOV.UK Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph), also known as govGraph, is a knowledge graph tool that allows us to:

- explore graph databases and knowledge graphs for GOV.UK applications
- collaborate with other teams and communities to help them find content more easily
- build products and apps that allow further insights about our content such as the journey visualisation app
- upskill colleagues and drive culture change to make better use of data and improve data literacy in GOV.UK
- provide early adopters with access and training to help scale use of our data apps and product

One of the most common uses is that GOV.UK Knowledge Graph provides a queryable platform for content designers to answer common content questions.

There are two versions of the graph:

- a [stable graph](https://knowledge-graph.integration.govuk.digital:7473/browser/) for content designers to query
- an [experimental graph](https://knowledge-graph-lab.integration.govuk.digital:7473/browser/) for the Data Labs team which includes extra NLP derived features

The graph connects siloed data from analytics (the functional network) to content data metadata such as the title, body, or which organisations publish content. We also use graph algorithms to derive new features, such as the popularity of content with the weighted PageRank algorithm.

Complete this [introduction lesson](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8vati8E5aPJk_p0RYxu2yw2gJK_y6ikvi5VReV4YVs/edit) to understand more about how GOV.UK Knowledge Graph works.

For more information, see the following:

- this [blog post on Knowledge Graph](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/07/one-graph-to-rule-them-all/)
- the [GOV.UK developer documentation Knowledge Graph page](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/knowledge-graph.html)
- [example queries](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/tree/master/src/neo4j/favourite_queries) in the repo
- [example requests](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1uh7tKgHDkQF12pXS9-q7rUa2pHq8fGdo) from content designers

If you have questions, you can contact:

- [Esther Woods](mailto:esther.woods@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) in the content community

## Use the preprocessed content store

The preprocessed content store (PPCS) is a download of the GOV.UK website in `.csv` format. The PPCS contains data and metadata about every page on GOV.UK.

The PPCS is used:

- to build the structural network component in the [GOV.UK Knowledge Graph](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/analysis/govgraph/#use-gov-uk-knowledge-graph), which shows each and every page (available in the content store) connects to any other via hyperlink
- to generate [GOV.UK accessibility reports](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-accessibility-reports)
- by the [`govuk-entity-personalisation` app](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-entity-personalisation) to generate a file that powers the auto-complete component of the personalisation feature

### Access the PPCS

The GOV.UK Knowledge Graph creates the PPCS automatically each day.

To access the PPCS, you:

- sign into AWS and select the correct AWS role
- download a copy of the production version of the PPCS to your local machine

#### Sign into AWS and select the correct AWS role

1. Sign into AWS. See the [GOV.UK Developer Docs on getting AWS access](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#7-get-aws-access) for more information.

1. Select your name in the top right of the screen and select __Switch roles__.

1. Under __Account__, you can select select __govuk-infrastructure-integration__ or __210287912431__.

1. Under __Role__, select __govuk-datascienceusers__.

1. You can enter any text into __Display name__ or leave this field empty.

1. You can select any colour in __Colour__. Best practice is to select green for integration, amber for staging and red for production.

1. Select __Switch Role__.

#### Download a copy of the PPCS to your local machine

1. Go to [`govuk-data-infrastructure-integration` S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/govuk-data-infrastructure-integration?region=eu-west-1&tab=objects)

1. Go to the __knowledge-graph__ folder.

1. Go to the latest date folder and select the `preprocessed_content_store_DDMMYY.csv.gz` file.

1. Select __Download__ to download the file to your local machine.
