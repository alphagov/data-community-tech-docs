# How the GOV.UK Knowledge Graph works

The [GOV.UK Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph), also known as govGraph, is a [knowledge graph](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/knowledge-graphs) that:

- combines structural GOV.UK information with user behaviour into a single data structure
- uses this data structure to build a knowledge graph with nodes that represent real-life concepts such as person name and address

The Knowledge Graph allows you to:

- explore graph databases and knowledge graphs for GOV.UK applications
- collaborate with other teams and communities to help them find content more easily
- build products and applications that tell users about our content, such as the weighted PageRank algorithm
- improve colleagues’ data literacy so they can make better use of GOV.UK data
- provide early adopters with access and training to help increase use of our data applications and product

## Data sources

The Knowledge Graph has 4 data sources:

- the [Content Store](https://github.com/alphagov/content-store)
- the [GOV.UK Publishing API](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api)
- the [GOV.UK Organisations API](link: https://www.api.gov.uk/gds/gov-uk-organisations/#gov-uk-organisations)
- BigQuery Google Analytics data

### Content Store

The Content Store is used to build a structural network. In the structural network:

- the network nodes are GOV.UK content items, mostly corresponding to pages on GOV.UK
- the network edges are hyperlinks between those content items

In this context, a page is a GOV.UK content item, not a URL.

The Content Store is also used to create:

- node labels or node categories, like Brexit or Farming
- additional nodes like Taxon, Step-by-Step and Chapter nodes
- relationships between nodes and/or node types types to the graph, like "has_taxon", "has_organisation"

### Publishing API and the Organisations API are

The Publishing API and the Organisations API are used to enrich the network of content-item nodes by linking these nodes to content metadata such as publishing organisation, departmental organisation and people within these organisations.

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics data from 2 days before is used to build a functional network.

This network visualises user movement between specified content items (pages), which captures how users are navigating to and from these pages.

## Create the Knowledge Graph

There are 2 instances of the Knowledge Graph:

- the [user-facing Knowledge Graph](https://knowledge-graph.integration.govuk.digital:7473/browser/) that content designers use to answer common content questions
- the [more advanced Knowledge Graph](https://knowledge-graph-lab.integration.govuk.digital:7473/browser/) that data professionals use for experiments

To create the Knowledge Graph instances, every day at 5am the following applications are automatically run in sequence:

- [`app-data-science`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/tree/master/terraform/projects/app-data-science)
- [`app-knowledge-graph`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/blob/master/terraform/projects/app-knowledge-graph)

The `app-data-science` application runs the [`build_knowledge_graph_data` Python script](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/build_knowledge_graph_data). This script generates [intermediate data files](#intermediate-data-files) from the 4 data sources and copies those files to these AWS S3 buckets:

- `govuk-data-infrastructure-integration` in these subdirectories:
    - `knowldge_graph`
    - `structural_network`
    - `functional-network/DATE/`
- `govuk-related-links-integration`

The `app-knowledge-graph` application runs these bash scripts to build the 2 knowledge graphs from the intermediate data files:

- the [`provision_knowledge_graph` bash script](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/provision_knowledge_graph) builds the user-facing Knowledge Graph
- the [`provision_knowledge_graph_lab` bash script](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/provision_knowledge_graph_lab) builds the experimental Knowledge Graph for data professionals

The Knowledge Graph instances are password-protected. [Ask the GOV.UK Data Labs team on Slack](https://gds.slack.com/archives/CHR4UQKU4) for the username and password to view the Knowledge Graph instances.

Once you have the username and password, you can view the updated [user-facing Knowledge Graph](https://knowledge-graph.integration.govuk.digital:7473/browser/) and the [experimental Knowledge Graph](https://knowledge-graph-lab.integration.govuk.digital:7473/browser/) for data professionals.

## Intermediate data files

The following intermediate data files are used to build the 2 instances of the Knowledge Graph.

### preprocessed_content_store_<DDMMYY>.csv.gz

A data set of most GOV.UK content pages with multiple attributes for each page.

This data set is made of Content Store data, but excludes:

- excludes [document types that are blocked from the topic taxonomy](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/config/document_types_excluded_from_the_topic_taxonomy.yml)
- only retrieves data for documents with a `Locale` field of `English`
- only retrieves content items with a `Phase` field of `Live`

The `ContentStore` Python class, defined in [`src.data.extract_contect_store.py`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/src/data/extract_content_store.py) and instantiated in [`src.build_graph_data.py`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/src/build_graph_data.py) retrieves the relevant Content Store data and saves it to a [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html).

The [`build_knowledge_graph_data`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/build_knowledge_graph_data) script exports a copy of this dataframe as the `preprocessed_content_store_<DDMMYY>.csv.gz` file to the `govuk-data-infrastructure-integration/knowldge_graph/` subdirectory in the AWS S3 bucket.

The dataframe is also used to instantiate the [`CreateContentGraph` Python class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/src/data/create_graph.py), which then generates other intermediate data files which are components of the Knowledge Graph.

The `preprocessed_content_store_<DDMMYY>.csv.gz` file has the following data fields.

If you have questions, you can contact the following groups on Slack:

- the [GOV.UK Data Labs team](https://gds.slack.com/archives/CHR4UQKU4)
- the [GOV.UK data champions](https://app.slack.com/client/T8GT9416G/C02CM46TD52)








main knowledge graph made of

sub graphs of nodes that are of following types:
main 7
- Cid (content ID)
- organisation
- person
- taxon
- role
- step
- chapter
other 3
- COVID 19
- ExternalPage
- Mainstream


can combine these graphs in different ways to produce different overall knowledge graph outputs

separate sub graphs, no direct link between entities in different sub graphs, the way you write your queries, you can pull info from combination of these sub graphs

knowledge graph is open to including new nodes - if someone extracts new data in the future from gov.uk pages, then we can store that data as a node type and then use it with other sub graphs to get different outputs

these sub graphs are created in the bash script named [provision_knowledge_graph bash script](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/blob/master/provision_knowledge_graph)

cid node type sub graph

a knowledge graph is a list of node or things

we've decided that the nodes of type x are nodes we are interested in

a pirmary node type is content id, content item id'ed by content id

those nodes are primarily connected by relationships of type hyperlink

https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph/tree/master/src/neo4j
source code files that injest the csv files into the graph in terms of nodes and links

these linked nodes make up the structural network

this sub graph contains these attributes / information i.e. every gov.uk page that has a content id has the following information ["public_updated_at", "first_published_at", "publishing_app", "documentType", "updated_at", "text", "contentID", "name", "title", "description"]

relationships that can exist between nodes of type content id

HAS_ORGANISATIONS
HAS_ORIGINAL_PRIMARY_PUBLISHING_ORGANISATION
HAS_PRIMARY_PUBLISHING_ORGANISATION
HYPERLINKS_TO
HAS_SUGGESTED_ORDERED_RELATED_ITEMS

what relationships there are to other sub graphs

some content id nodes are classified as other types, external page, organisation, covid
