# GOV.UK Knowledge Graph nodes and relationships

All of the following nodes and relationships are created in/by `src/neo4j/import_edgelist.cypher`, except for `Cid - ExternalPage - HYPERLINKS_TO`.

The `Cid - ExternalPage - HYPERLINKS_TO` node and relationship is created in/by `src/neo4j/import_external_links.cypher`.

| Source node type<br>(relationship FROM) | Target node type<br>(relationship TO) | Relationships<br>(edges) | Description |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ContentID (Cid) | ContentID (Cid) | HYPERLINKS _TO | Is there a hyperlink from the source node to the target node |
| ContentID (Cid) | ContentID (Cid) | USER _MOVEMENT | Using (weighted) functional edges, capture the number of user movements from the source node to the target node (content items) over the previous 3 weeks (ending 2 days prior to the current date). |
| ContentID (Cid) | ContentID (Cid) | HAS _SUGGESTED _ORDERED _RELATED _ITEMS | The target node is an algorithmically-generated related link on the source node. |
| ContentID (Cid) | ContentID (Cid) | HAS _SIMILAR _CONTENT | Based on old data.<br>Highlight that source and target Cid have similar content (not sure what method was used to identify “similar content”) |
| Cid | Chapter | HAS _CHAPTER | Some pages (of type “guide”) are split into Chapters.<br>This indicates that a given Cid (the source node) contains the target content item as one of its chapters. |
| Cid | ExternalPage | HYPERLINKS _TO | Expresses the fact that a page on `www.gov.uk` links to an external page (eg assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) |
| Cid | Taxon | IS _TAGGED _TO | Some ContentIDs are linked to taxons (eg, “Benefits entitlement” or “Welfare”) |
| Cid | Step | HAS _STEP | “Step-by-step” pages on GOV.UK are divided in steps. |
| Step | Cid | HAS _TASK | Each step in a step-by-step page includes a Task (a link to another page) |
| Person | Role | HAS _ROLE | Links a person to their role in a government organisation |
| Role | Organisation | BELONGS _TO | Expresses that a specific role (eg Deputy High Commissioner to Ghana”) belongs to a government organisation (eg, “FCDO”) |
| Organisation | Organisation | HAS _CHILD | Expresses that a department is part of another department |
| Organisation | Organisation | HAS _SUPERSEDED | Expresses that an organisation has been renamed or replaced by another one. Eg, NHS Digital has superseded the Health and Social Care Information Centre |
| Cid | Organisation | HAS _ORIGINAL _PRIMARY _PUBLISHING _ORGANISATION | How each ContentID is related to an original primary publishing organisation |
| Cid | Organisation | HAS _PRIMARY _PUBLISHING _ORGANISATION | How each ContentID is related to a primary publishing organisation |
| Cid | Organisation | HAS _ORGANISATIONS | How each ContentID is related to an organisation |
| Taxon | Taxon | HAS _PARENT | Expresses that a taxon is part of another taxon. Eg, the parent of the “Sentencing reform” and “Byelaws” taxons is “Crime, justice and law” |
| Taxon | Taxon | SHARES _COMMUNITY | This is an “inferred relationship” using a label-propagation algorithm that identifies “similar” taxons as taxons that are tagged from the same pages. |

## Special non-mutually exclusive content-related labels

Certain nodes of type `Cid` are also assigned a separate type (for example, Farming) or combination of separate types (for example Farming, Mainstream) if they meet certain criteria.
