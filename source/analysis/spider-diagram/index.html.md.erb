# Use the spider diagram tool

The reverse path tool is...

Visualisation displaying entry and exit data of a GOV.UK page of interest, over a date range and device category(ies). This data is broken down further by internal/external links, and the individual entry/exit pages paired with the count and proportion of page views. Answers the question, 'In regards to page X, which page have users come from, and which page do they go to next?'
