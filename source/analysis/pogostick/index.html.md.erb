# Use the pogo-sticking dashboards

Pogo-sticking is when a user navigates repeatedly through the same web page within a user journey.

There are 2 types of pogo-sticking:

- internal, which is navigating repeatedly through GOV.UK pages
- external, which is navigating repeatedly GOV.UK and non-GOV.UK pages

There are 3 pogo-sticking dashboards:

- the [main pogo-sticking dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/28806d62-5478-4fe2-95d6-be80facf03c0/page/iOQ7B) is for all users and shows the internal and external pogo-sticking rate for GOV.UK pages
- the [pogo-sticking dashboard page tracking dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/72caf3b3-a61c-406a-81f3-16b01774bdb6/page/UfHLC) is for the data labs team and shows if the main pogo-sticking dashboard is being used, and how
- the [pogo-sticking between "smart answer clicked" pages dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/398d305d-faf0-452e-88b5-210932e4775c/page/YR8MC) shows the pogo sitcking rate between different tabs and different smart answers
