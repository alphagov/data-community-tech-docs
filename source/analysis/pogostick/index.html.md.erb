# Use the pogo-sticking dashboard

Pogo-sticking is when a user navigates repeatedly through the same web page within a user journey.

There are 2 types of pogo-sticking:

- internal, which is navigating repeatedly through GOV.UK
- external, which is navigating repeatedly through an external search

The [pogo-sticking dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/28806d62-5478-4fe2-95d6-be80facf03c0/page/iOQ7B) provides access to the internal and external pogo-sticking rate for GOV.UK pages.

You can view the pogo-sticking dashboard if you have a `@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` Google account.

## Use the dashboard

The dashboard is split into internal and external pogo-sticking.

These sections have the same metrics for both within GOV.UK and external search.

To get pogo-sticking metrics, you must specify 2 variables.

1. Select a a date or date range in the top right hand corner.

1. Enter a page path in the __Page equals__ field. The page path must always start with `/`.

  For example, if you want the pogo-sticking metrics for `https://www.gov.uk/travel-abroad`, enter `/travel-abroad`. The input text must match the page path exactly.

1. Within the internal and external sections, these sections are split between the original page of interest, and a page to compare that original page to. You can also enter a page path in the __Page equals__ field under __Comparisons with another page__.

You can now view the pogo-sticking metrics.

### Metrics

#### Total number of sessions

The total number of sessions for the particular date or date range for Desktop and Mobile devices.

#### Percentage of the sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking

The percentage of sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking for Desktop and Mobile devices for a particular date or date range, averaged over the dates.

For example, if the total number of sessions is 1000, and the % of sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking is 45%, then pogo-sticking occurred during 450 out of 1000 sessions.

#### Time-series graph

This graph plots the percentage of the sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking rate for Desktop and Mobile over the past 28 days. Hover your cursor over the graph to see the percentages.

#### Common pogo-sticking sequences

This table displays the most common pogo-sticking sequences over a date or date range.

Count is in descending order. Desktop and Mobile journeys are summed together.

Comparisons

Original pogo-sticking rate (as above): both the total number of sessions and % of the sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking are repeated. This is so the user does not need to keep scrolling up and down the page.

Comparisons with another page: type in a page path (URL - the page of interest) to compare the results to. Similarly as above, the page path must always start with ‘/’. This is of use to users who want to compare the results of one page path to another page path.

Comparisons with other document types that triggered pogo-sticking: each plot represents a different document type: guide, transaction, step-by-step navigation. These plots include all page paths of the specified document type. Under the document type heading, e.g. Guide, a table presents the metrics: minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum pogo-sticking rate. For example, if the minimum pogo-sticking rate is 2%, this means that the lowest pogo-sticking rate of any page path characterised as a Guide is 2%. If the 25th percentile is 16%, then this means that 25% of page paths characterised as Guide have a pogo-sticking rate less than 16%. The plot displays the quartile ranges (lower-, inter-, upper-). The black dot and value represents the average pogo-sticking rate for the page path of interest. Note: Desktop and Mobile pogo-sticking rates are averaged together.
