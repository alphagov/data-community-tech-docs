# Use the pogo-sticking dashboards

Pogo-sticking is when a user navigates repeatedly through the same web page within a user journey.

There are 2 types of pogo-sticking:

- internal, which is navigating repeatedly through GOV.UK pages
- external, which is navigating repeatedly GOV.UK and non-GOV.UK pages

There are 3 pogo-sticking dashboards:

- the [main pogo-sticking dashboard](/analysis/pogostick/main/) is for all users and shows the internal and external pogo-sticking rate for GOV.UK pages
- the [pogo-sticking dashboard page tracking dashboard](/analysis/pogostick/tracking/) is for the data labs team and shows if the main pogo-sticking dashboard is being used, and how
- the [pogo-sticking between "smart answer clicked" pages dashboard](/analysis/pogostick/smartanswer/) shows the pogo sticking rate when a user clicks a link that opens in a new tab, and this link triggers a `SmartAnswerClicked` event
