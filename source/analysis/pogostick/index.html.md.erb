# Using the pogo-sticking dashboard

Pogo-sticking is when a user quickly navigates back and forth from a web page within the same user session

For example, a user navigates from Page A to Page B back to Page A and then to Page C.

There are 2 types of pogo-sticking:

- internal, which is navigating quickly back and forth from a GOV.UK page to other GOV.UK pages
- external, which is navigating quickly back and forth from an external search result page, such as Google, to GOV.UK pages

Previously there were 3 pogo-sticking dashboards. These have been replaced by one dashboard which uses GOV.UK GA4 data. The dashboard can be found here:

- the [main pogo-sticking dashboard](/analysis/pogostick/main/) is for all users and shows the internal and external pogo-sticking rate for GOV.UK pages
