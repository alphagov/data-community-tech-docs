# Use the main pogo-sticking dashboard

Pogo-sticking is when a user navigates repeatedly through the same web page within a user journey.

There are 2 types of pogo-sticking:

- internal, which is navigating repeatedly through GOV.UK pages
- external, which is navigating repeatedly GOV.UK and non-GOV.UK pages

The [main pogo-sticking dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/28806d62-5478-4fe2-95d6-be80facf03c0/page/iOQ7B) shows the internal and external pogo-sticking rate for GOV.UK pages.

You can view the pogo-sticking dashboard if you have a `@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` Google account.

This dashboard does not track when users pogo-stick between different smart answer results. You can track this behaviour using the [pogo-sticking between "smart answer clicked" pages dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/398d305d-faf0-452e-88b5-210932e4775c/page/YR8MC).

## Use the dashboard

The dashboard is split into internal and external pogo-sticking.

These sections have the same metrics for both internal and external pogo-sticking.

To get pogo-sticking metrics, you must specify 2 variables.

1. Select a date or date range in the top right hand corner.

1. Enter a page path in the __Page equals__ field. The page path must always start with `/`.

    For example, if you want the pogo-sticking metrics for `https://www.gov.uk/travel-abroad`, enter `/travel-abroad`. The input text must match the page path exactly.

1. Within the internal and external sections, these sections are split between the original page of interest, and a page to compare that original page to.

  You can also enter a page path in the __Page equals__ field under __Comparisons with another page__.

You can now view the pogo-sticking metrics.

## Metrics

### Total number of sessions

The total number of sessions for the particular date or date range for Desktop and Mobile devices.

This metric is in both the original page and comparison page sections.

### Percentage of the sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking

The percentage of sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking for Desktop and Mobile devices for a particular date or date range, averaged over the dates.

For example, if the total number of sessions is 1000, and the % of sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking is 45%, then pogo-sticking occurred during 450 out of 1000 sessions.

This metric is in both the original page and comparison page sections.

### Time-series graph

This graph plots the percentage of the sessions where the page triggered pogo-sticking rate for Desktop and Mobile over the past 28 days. Hover your cursor over the graph to see the percentages.

### Common pogo-sticking sequences

This table displays the most common pogo-sticking sequences over a date or date range.

Count is in descending order. Desktop and Mobile journeys are summed together.

### Comparisons with other document types that triggered pogo-sticking

There are 3 plotted graphs in the __Comparisons with other document types that triggered pogo-sticking__ section.

Each plot represents a different document type; guide, transaction and step-by-step navigation. These plots include all page paths of the specified document type.

Under the document type, a table presents the following pogo-sticking rate metrics:

- minimum
- 25th percentile
- median
- 75th percentile
- maximum

Using the Guide plot as an example, if the:

- minimum pogo-sticking rate is 2%, this means that the lowest pogo-sticking rate of any page path characterised as a Guide is 2%
- 25th percentile is 16%, this means that 25% of page paths characterised as Guide have a pogo-sticking rate less than 16%.

The plot displays the quartile ranges (lower-, inter-, upper-).

The black dot and value represents the average pogo-sticking rate for the page path of interest.

Desktop and Mobile pogo-sticking rates are averaged together.
