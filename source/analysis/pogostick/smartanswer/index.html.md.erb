# Use the pogo-sticking between "smart answer clicked" pages dashboard

Pogo-sticking is when a user navigates repeatedly through the same web page within a user journey.

The method to calculate pogo-sticking on the main dashboard does not capture pogo-sticking when a user opens up a page in a different tab to the one they are using.

This happens because a page view is recorded when a browser requests a page from the GOV.UK servers. This does not happen when a user switches tabs in their browser to view a page that they had previously loaded and that is still open on a tab.

This means that we cannot calculate pogo-sticking for pages where links on the pogo-sticking page open up in a new tab. An example of this is `/next-steps-for-your-business/results`. However, we can instead use `EVENT` hits to calculate pogo-sticking on this page.

The [pogo-sticking between "smart answer clicked" pages dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/398d305d-faf0-452e-88b5-210932e4775c/page/YR8MC) shows the pogo sticking rate when a user clicks a link that opens in a new tab, and this link triggers a `SmartAnswerClicked` event.

You can view this pogo-sticking dashboard if you have a `@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` Google account.

You should check if your page of interest uses the event category `SmartAnswerClicked`. If you are unsure, please [email the Data Labs team](mailto:gov.uk-data-labs@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## How pogo-sticking is calculated for different tabs and smart answers

This is an adaptation of an [existing method that was developed but not used for internal pogo-sticking](https://github.com/alphagov/user-journey-metrics/blob/main/src/make_data/queries/get_pogo_internal_page_stepbystep_m1.sql).

In this method, the only hit kept are `PAGE` hits and the eventCategory `SmartAnswerClicked`. Therefore, pogo-sticking occurs when `A + "L" > B >  A + "L" > C`.

In this method:

- `A` is the pogo-sticking pagePath
- `L` is eventCategory "SmartAnswerClicked"
- `B` and `C` are the pagePaths associated with the preceding `SmartAnswerClicked` eventCategory

As such, this method detects pogo-sticking when a user:

- is on a pagePath
- selects a SmartAnswer URL
- visits the SmartAnswer pagePath
- goes back to the original pagePath and selects a second SmartAnswer URL
- visits the SmartAnswer pagePath

## Assumptions and caveats

### Assumption 1

Pogo-sticking only occurs when a SmartAnswer URL is selected on the same pagePath (PAGE A).

### Assumption 2

Pogo-sticking does not occur if other page interactions occurs on PAGE A or PAGE B, such as scrolling down the page.

### Assumption 3

Pogo-sticking does not occur if a SmartAnswer URL is selected on a different pagePath (not PAGE A).

### Assumption 4

Pogo-sticking does not occur if 2 or more pagePaths are visited between the pogo-sticking page (PAGE A).

### Assumption 5

PAGE C in the example pattern could also be PAGE B (e.g. A + "L"   > B >  A + "L" > B; the user selects the same SmartAnswer URL twice).

### Assumption 6

It is likely that more journeys than pogo-sticking rate sessions will be recorded.

If, for example, 50 sessions demonstrate pogo-sticking, 70 different journeys might be recorded.

This is because the pogo-sticking rate calculates distinct sessions. That is, the number of sessions that include at least one instance of pogo-sticking.

The journeys will show all journeys taken, even if 2 journeys occur in the same session.

For example, if user A pogo-sticks from `/next-steps-for-your-business/results > /vat-registration > /next-steps-for-your-business/results > /corporation-tax` and `/next-steps-for-your-business/results > /export-goods > /next-steps-for-your-business/results > /licence-finder` in the same session, this will be counted as 1 for the pogo-sticking rate, but 2 for the journeys.
