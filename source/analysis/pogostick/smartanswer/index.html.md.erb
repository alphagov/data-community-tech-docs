# Use the pogo-sticking between "smart answer clicked" pages dashboard

Pogo-sticking is when a user navigates repeatedly through the same web page within a user journey.

There are 2 types of pogo-sticking:

- internal, which is navigating repeatedly through GOV.UK pages
- external, which is navigating repeatedly GOV.UK and non-GOV.UK pages


between smartanswerclicked events
certain pages have smartanswerclicked events
you cannot track when users go back and forth between smartanswer pages (different pages)
also doesnt capture when you go between different tabs
users should check if this applies to their page
this dashboard tracks pogo sitcking between different tabs and between different smart answers
alice to track down assumptions and caveats
