# Using the pogo-sticking dashboard page tracking dashboard

Pogo-sticking is when a user quickly navigates back and forth from a web page within the same user session

For example, a user navigates from Page A to Page B back to Page A and then to Page C.

The [pogo-sticking dashboard page tracking dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/72caf3b3-a61c-406a-81f3-16b01774bdb6/page/UfHLC) is for the Data Products team and shows if the main pogo-sticking dashboard is being used, and how.

To view the metrics on how users are using the main pogo-sticking dashboard, you can either:

- go directly to the dashboard and then go to the metrics section
- view the metrics data in Google Analytics

The dashboard has a set amount of metrics. If you want to customise and explore the data more, you should use Google Analytics instead of the dashboard.

### Pogo-sticking page - New users over the previous 30 days

### Pogo-sticking page - Timing

Set the date range of interest for the analysis.

Each record is a page view of the pogo-sticking page.

If the pogo-sticking page is the last page the user visits before leaving the dashboard, Exits are recorded as 1.

__Time on Page__ is recorded. Google Analytics cannot measure the time a user spent looking at the last page of their visit.

This happens because Google uses the time of the next page view to determine the time the user spent looking at the current page.

On the last page, there is no next page recorded, so the __Time on Page__ is unknown.

So, if the user exits from the pogo-sticking dashboard, __Time on Page__ is recorded as 00:00:00, and Exits = 1.
