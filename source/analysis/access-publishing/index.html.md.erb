# Access the GOV.UK publishing database

The GOV.UK publishing database is a PostgreSQL database that keeps a copy of every version of every page published on GOV.UK.

You can access the publishing database instead of [downloading the GOV.UK mirror to your local machine](/analysis/mirror/). You can use the publishing database to compute intents.

The data community does not currently have access to the production environment of the publishing database, so we access the database using the integration environment.

## Connect to the publishing database

Before you start, you must:

- have access to AWS
- install the GDS command line tools
- connect to the GDS VPN
- get Secure Shell (SSH) access to the integration environment

See the [Get started on GOV.UK developer documentation](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html) for more information on how to do this.

1. Run the following in the command line to connect to an AWS instance in the integration environment:

    ```
    USER=<FIRSTNAMELASTNAME>; gds govuk connect --environment integration ssh publishing_api
    ```

    `<FIRSTNAMELASTNAME>` must be the same user that you created to SSH into integration.

    You do not need to include `USER=<FIRSTNAMELASTNAME>;` if your username for your machine is the same as the SSH integration user.

1. Open a psql terminal to the `postgresql-primary` host as the `aws_db_admin` user, and connect to the publishing API database:

    ```
    sudo psql -U aws_db_admin -h postgresql-primary --no-password -d publishing_api_production
    ```

    This database is named `production`, but it is not in the production environment.
