# Use the forward path tool

The forward path tool shows the pages a user visits after visiting a page of interest on GOV.UK.

This tool outputs a CSV file with the count and proportion of user sessions visiting distinct, subsetted journeys for a specified date range. This list of sessions is in the CSV file as a sorted list in descending order, categorised by device.

___Tried to rephrase this but not sure - what does distinct subsetted journeys mean?___

To use the forward path tool, you must do the following.

1. Download the forward path tool notebook.
1. Open the tool notebook in Google Colab.
1. Run the notebook.

## Download the forward path tool

___Do you need any specific permission to do this?___

Download the notebook from GitHub.

1. Go to the [`govuk-user-journey-analysis-tools` GitHub repo][repository].
1. Select the __Code__ button, and then select __Download Zip__.
1. Unzip the __govuk-user-journey-analysis-tools__ folder and go to the __notebooks__ folder.
1. Save the __forward-path-tool__ Jupyter notebook to your Google Drive account.

## Open the tool notebook in Google Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You will see an window to open a notebook.
1. Select the __Google Drive__ tab and open the __forward-path-tool__ notebook.

___Cannot find below___

You may need to 'connect' the notebook to be associated with Google Colab the first time you open a Jupyter
notebook from Google Drive. To do this, look for the link at the top-centre of the page which says something
like `Connect more apps` (see screenshot below), search for `Google Colaboratory` and then accept any required
permissions it asks for. Once you have associated Jupyter notebooks with Google Colab, the notebook should open.

## Run the tool notebook

To run the notebook, you must do the following.

1. Authenticate your access.
1. Set the query parameters.

### Authenticate your access

1. Hover your cursor over the cell that starts with the code `from datetime import datetime` to show the run icon. Select the run icon to start the authentication process.
1. Select the authentication link in the text box and then select your Google account.
1. Follow the on screen prompts, selecting __Allow__ when prompted, and copy the __Sign in code__ when this code appears.
1. Go back to the text box in the notebook and paste the sign in code into the __Enter verification code__ field.
1. Select __Enter__ to complete authentication.

If you receive a warning message saying "The notebook was not authored by Google", select __Run Anyway__.

### Set the query parameters

You set the query parameters in the __Set query parameters__ cell.

You must set the following mandatory query parameters:

- start and end dates for the analysis
- desired page path of interest
- the number of pages or events the user journeys will be subsetted by
- whether to include page and/or event hits
- device categories to include



whether query strings are removed from the page path of interest,
 whether page paths associated with events are appended with an [E],
 whether page paths associated with events are appended with event information event category,
 event action, and/or event label, whether journeys that include the entrance page should be flagged,
 whether refreshes of the page of interest should be removed
 whether search pages only show the search content type, and search keywords.





3.


2. Next, edit the `Set query parameters` cell.

   - There are a number of query parameters that are mandatory to set.
   - Mandatory: .
   - Optional:
3. Once you are happy with the query parameters, ensure the cell is selected, select `Runtime`, then `Run after`

   - The notebook will run each cell following the `Set query parameters` cell one at a time.


4. The notebook should automatically scroll down to `cell 5`. If you are waiting what seems like a long time, then manually scroll down to `cell 5`

   - This cell executes a dry run for the query, which estimates the number of gigabytes read by the query
   - If you are happy to continue, type `yes` into the user input box
   - Note:  the query will only run if you type `yes` in the user input box. If you leave the input blank or type in something else, the query will not be executed, and the code will stop running

5. A local copy of the data generated is exported in a CSV file.
   - If no files are downloaded, check the end of the URL search bar. If you see a download icon with a red cross (as shown below), select the icon and change the option to `Always allow....` before clicking `Done`
