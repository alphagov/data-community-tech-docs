# Use the GOV.UK publishing database

The GOV.UK publishing database is a PostgreSQL database that keeps a copy of every version of every page published on GOV.UK.

The Content Store only cantains the latest version of pages that are currently published on GOV.UK.

All the data that is in the Content Store is obtained from the Publishing API database.

The Link Expansion process occurs while data is being transferred from the Publishing API database into the Content Store.

Do previous versions of expanded links get preserved in the Publishing API database?

## Differences between the Publishing API database and the Content Store

* The Publishing API database contains every version of every page that was ever
  published or drafted.
* The Content Store contains the most recent version of every page that is
  currently published.  The Draft Content Store also contains the most recent
  version of every page that has been drafted (what about when a page is both
  published and drafted?)
* The Content Store contains the results of Link Expansion, which is a process
  that chooses which links to display, from among all the links that exist
  between pages.
