# Use the reverse path tool

The reverse path tool is...

A CSV file presenting the previous page paths that reached a GOV.UK page of interest, over a date range and device category(ies). The count and proportion of sessions visiting distinct, subsetted journeys are compiled together, and returned as a sorted list in descending order. Answers the question, 'Which pages do users visit before arriving at page X?'
