# Use the baseline model

___who is this for???___

This is a simplified version of the algorithm that does not involved any spreading activation from visited to non-visited pages, and that limits the "content" of a visited page to the text in its URL.

Thus, intents are derived from terms in the URLs of the pages that were actually visited in a user session, weighted by their TF-IDF. Terms that have been viewed on multiple pages are weighted by the sum of their TF-IDF weights on those pages.

Prerequisites
A dataset of sessions and the URLs visited, where the URLs have been pruned and cleaned so that they conform to - the ones in the GOV.UK mirror and the TF-IDF matrix.

To create this file, run the python script, following the instructions therein: src.make_data.download_session_pages.py

A TF-IDF matrix of terms extracted from the URLs of the pages in the GOV.UK mirror.

To create this file, run the python script, following the instructions therein: src.make_data.generate_topology_matrix.py

Baseline model implementation
The implementation of the baseline model is in notebooks/baseline_models_poc/baseline_2_tfidf_visited_urls_all_govuk.py
