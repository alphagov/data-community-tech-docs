# Use the IUNIS algorithm

In the Inferring User Needs by Information Scents (IUNIS) algorithm, the list of keywords that represent the user journeyâ€™s intent are driven by the:

- pages that a user visits in their journey
- possible pages that they could have visited but did not,

The algorithm weights pages according to how rare those pages are across all user journeys in the specified time period.

The algorithm then weights the derived keywords by how important and unique those words are to the weighted pages compared to the rest of GOV.UK. Only the top-weighted keywords are kept.

To use IUNIS, you must create the:

- page term TF-IDF matrix
- page-access weighting matrix
- step function alpha vector
- topology matrix

Then, run the IUNIS algorithm on the step-alpha function.
