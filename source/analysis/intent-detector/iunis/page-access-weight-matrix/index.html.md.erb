# Create the page access weight matrix

The page access TF-IDF weight matrix gives less weight to pages that are accessed by many users and are not relevant to the user's information needs. For example, the GOV.UK homepage.

## Definitions

The following definitions apply to this matrix:

- `user` is defined as either `sessionId` or `fullVisitorId`
- `pages` are the pages in the curated set of user journeys, otherwise known as `target urls`
- `term frequency` (TF) is the access frequency of the page by the given user
- `inverse document frequency` (IDF) is the ratio of total users to the number of distinct users who have accessed the given page

## Create the matrix

1. Go to the `intent-detector` repo folder on your local machine.

1. Run `python src/make_data/make_user_page_access_matrix.py` in your command line.

    Specify the following positional arguments in the script:
    - `--which-user` (optional, default is `sessionId`) states whether the user in the user-page access matrix is the `sessionId` or the `fullVisitorId`
    - `--start_date` (required) is the start date to query as a `YYYYMMDD` string, for example `20210428`
    - `--end_date` (required) is the end date to query as a `YYYYMMDD` string, for example `20210428`
    - `--tfidf-log` (optional, default is `1 : 'yes'`) states whether to use the log of the IDF in the TF-IDF calculation

    For example, to create a visitor page access TF-IDF matrix for 28 April 2021 using the raw IDF, go to the root-level of the `intent-detector` repo and run the following in your command line:

    ```
    python -m src.make_data.make_user_page_access_matrix --start-date "20210428" \
    --end-date "20210428" --which-user "fullVisitorId" --tfidf-log 0
    ```

## Outputs

When you create the page access TF-IDF matrix, the script outputs 2 `.parquet` files to the `intent-detector` repo on your local machine:

- the raw output table of the SQL query, saved in the `data/interim/` folder as `{start_date>}_{end_date}_{chosen_user}_page_access_raw_table.parquet`
- the user-target page access TF-IDF matrix, saved in the `data/interim/` folder as `{start_date>}_{end_date}_{chosen_user}_{tfidf_log}_page_access_matrix.parquet`
