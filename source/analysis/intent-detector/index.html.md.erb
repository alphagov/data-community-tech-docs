# Use the GOV.UK intent detector

The intent detector is a tool that analyses GOV.UK user journeys to better understand user intents.

## User intents definition

Intents summarise what a user came to do on GOV.UK and what their information needs are.

At a high level, inferred user intents are a summary of the content visited by a user in a session.

More specifically, a user journey's intent is a list of weighted keywords. The weights represent how important and distictive to that journey each keyword is.

This definition assumes that the content that a user visits as part of a session is relevant and informative to what the user wants to know or do.

This is based on cognitive theories of web navigation, which state that:

- users navigate content by following relevant information clues
- the content users visit is relevant to their information goals
- therefore, the content that a user visits represents their intents

Even if this assumption is false, many of the techniques for intent detection can still summarise a user's session.

## Before you start

have at least python 3.8 - https://www.python.org/downloads/

have at least R version 4.0.4 - https://cran.r-project.org/

Required packages installed; run the make requirements command in your terminal ___what does this mean?___

a copy of the gov.uk mirror on your local machine - /analysis/mirror/

install direnv so you can load env var - https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-intent-detector/blob/main/docs/user_guide/loading_environment_variables.md#loading-environment-variables

___apart from secrets, what other env var do i need to load with direnv???___

a .secrets file with secrets/credentials as environmental variables

In your terminal navigate to the root folder, and create a .secrets file.

touch .secrets

Open this new .secrets file using your preferred text editor, and add any secrets as environmental variables.

For example, to add a JSON credentials file for Google BigQuery, save the following changes to .secrets.

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/credentials.json"

Load the following secrets using direnv:

Environment variable name	Description
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account credentials	GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS	Absolute file path to your GCP credentials JSON file.

___how do i do this???___

Once complete, make sure the .secrets file has the following line uncommented out:

source_env ".secrets"
This ensures direnv loads the .secrets file via .envrc without version-controlling .secrets.

## Intent detector algorithsm

There are 3 algorithms to infer and detect intents.

- the Inferring User Needs by Information Scents (IUNIS) algorithm
- a simpler baseline model
- an even simpler model for performance analysts ___can we categorise them differently?___

See the documentation for these 3 algorithms to use them.
