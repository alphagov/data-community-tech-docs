# Make data accessible

By designing data and data visualisations in an accessible way we are making things better for everyone, and we will have a better chance of using our data analysis to influence change.

## Guidelines

Some guidelines to follow when visualising data:

- Don’t use colour alone to visualise information. Roughly 4.5% of the population suffer from sort of colour deficiency. Consider limiting your colour choices to four, and using direct labels or varied symbols and line styles
- Test your colours for accessibility. This includes testing the contrast of text on block colours, for example data labels on charts
- Label data directly rather than using data legends
- Keep it simple and pick the most simple chart for your visualisation
- Provide good alt text to images and charts. Good alt text should describe the information not the picture and focus on the key thing the chart communicates
- Test and iterate. Test how your visualisation looks on mobile or zoomed in. Consider what the user can see on a particular viewpoint - for example if there is too much white space
- Where possible, provide a link to the underlying data source as a table or sheet. Be aware that read only access to a Google Sheet doesn’t always unlock accessibility features so consider sharing sheets with edit permissions
