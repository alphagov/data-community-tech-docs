# Remove personally identifiable information (PII) from a single line of feedback data

The following content is for Data Insights team members that need to remove personally identifiable information (PII) from a single line of feedback data.

If you want to report PII to the Data Insights team, see the [documentation on reporting potential PII in feedback data](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AC/pages/3297345537/Report+potential+PII+in+feedback+data).

For more information on the feedback data set, see the [Zendesk and SmartSurvey feedback data pipeline documentation](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/reporting/zendesk-smartsurvey-feedback-data-pipeline/).

## Definition of PII

PII is any data that someone can use to identify a specific individual. For example:

- postal, email or IP addresses
- phone numbers
- social media posts or digital images
- geolocation, biometric, or behavioral data

PII can also be a combination of different pieces of information or data sets.

For example, a user flew to France on a certain date. This is not PII, but it is a small data set that could be combined with more information to identify the user.

For more information on PII, see [the Information Commissioner's Office definition of personal data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/).

## Before you start

To remove PII from feedback data, you must have:

- edit access to the BigQuery feedback data set - use the [DataAAA Slack channel](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C021V5Y6E3X) to ask the DataAAA team for this
- access to the Python3 notebooks and spreadsheets used for reporting - use the [Data Insights team Slack channel](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C015XA8KC4F) to ask the Data Insights team for this

There is a [Weekly PII removal from Feedback task](https://trello.com/c/wS8oRmKC/1020-weekly-pii-removal-from-feedback) in the Data Insights - Doing Trello board.

The Data Insights team assigns this task to a member of the team.

## Open the Feedback cleaning spreadsheet and Python notebook

1. Open the [Feedback cleaning spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18iQIoK_idParTmGpoNtdnInQMlMcxcWnoJmXJvtJK3A/edit#gid=925108377) to see which PII you need to remove.
1. Open the [Feedback PII cleansing Python notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C7D5NVO9-UYPlm4_FoBS-RSuBrvjTeZE) that contains the code to remove the PII.
1. In the notebook, select __Connect__ to start Python3.

## Authenticate your access to the feedback data set

1. Hover your cursor over the __Set up__ cell in the Python notebook to show the run icon and select the run icon to start the authentication process.
1. Select the authentication link in the text box and then select your Google account.
1. Follow the on screen prompts and copy the __Sign in code__ when it appears.
1. Go back to the text box in the notebook and paste the sign in code into the __Enter verification code__ field.
1. Select __Enter__ to complete authentication.

## Complete the __User input__ cell

Copy the PII from the Feedback cleaning spreadsheet to the __User input__ cell in the interactive Python notebook.

1. Copy the __Date of feedback__ data to the __Date_YYYYMMDD__ field. Convert the date format when doing this.
1. Use the __What was the source of the feedback?__ data to select the correct __Source__ from the drop down menu.
1. Copy the __What page was the feedback left on?__ data to the __Page_Path__ field.
1. Copy the __What question is the offending data in?__ data to the __Field__ field.
1. Copy the __What specifically should be removed?__ data to the __To_Redact__ field.
1. Hover your cursor over the cell and select the run icon.

The code has finished running when there is a green tick next to the run icon.

## Remove the PII from the feedback data

Go to the __Update query__ cell in the Python notebook. This cell has multiple code blocks:

- the first code block makes sure the PII to clean only matches one specific line in the feedback data set
- the second code block allows you to select a specific line to change in the feedback data set
- the third code block shows a comparison between the data set with the PII and what the data set will look like without the PII
- the fourth code block makes the change and removes the PII from the feedback data set

Run the first 3 code blocks in sequence. Do not run the fourth code block until you have checked you are changing the correct line in the feedback data set.

When you have run the fourth code block, you have removed PII from a single line of the feedback data set.

Check you have removed the PII correctly by:

- manually checking the feedback data set
- re-running the PII removal process

Update the __Cleaned__ column in the [feedback cleaning spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18iQIoK_idParTmGpoNtdnInQMlMcxcWnoJmXJvtJK3A/edit#gid=925108377).
