# Use Search Console data
Google Search Console provides data on searches that result in a page from a given domain being displayed as part of the Google search results.
This data can help you understand what terms users use to find content on our sites, and how well certain pages perform on the search results page.

This page provides some guidance on how to use Search Console data stored in [BigQuery](/tools/google-cloud-platform/bigquery/).

More information on the Search Console data available can be found on the [data source pages](/data-sources/gsc/).

## Use Search Console data in BigQuery

You can choose to access and query the Search Console data directly in BigQuery.

To do this, you will need access to view and query the data. 
All users who are granted [permissions to access GOV.UK GA4 data](/processes/ga-access/) are also granted permissions to access the GOV.UK Search Console data. 
GDS users will be able to run queries in a range of projects in BigQuery, such as the [GA4 analytics project](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-projects/#ga4-analytics) where the data is stored.
Users from other organisations will need to query the data from a Google Cloud Platform project with billing owned by their organisation.

If you are new to BigQuery, you may find it helpful to review Google’s [documentation explaining the BigQuery user interface](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui#open-ui).

### Tables and fields

Information on the two Search Console tables can be found on the [data source pages](/data-sources/gsc/).

Queries can be returned with `null` values if they are rare. In these cases, the 'is_anonymized_query' field should be marked with this bool.
The query field will be `null` when it is true to protect the privacy of users making the query.
More information on this can be found in [Google's documentation on Search Console performance data filtering and limits](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/10/performance-data-deep-dive#privacy-filtering).

### Example query

For example, if you wanted to get a list of GOV.UK URLs with the search terms used to surface them, and the number of impressions and clicks these terms led to, you could query something like the following:

```SQL
SELECT
  url,
  query,
  impressions,
  clicks,
FROM
  `ga4-analytics-352613.searchconsole_wwwgovuk.searchdata_url_impression`
WHERE
  data_date = "2024-01-01"
ORDER BY
  clicks DESC,
  impressions DESC
```

## Use Search Console data in Looker Studio

The Search Console data stored in BigQuery can be used in Looker Studio (and other reporting tools).
To do this, you will need the ID of a Google Cloud Platform project with billing enabled that is owned by your organisation.

### Connecting to the BigQuery data

If you are a member of GDS staff trying to access the GOV.UK Search Console data, please use the [shared data connections](https://trello.com/c/N8C3H9KT/55-looker-studio-data-sources).

If you are a member of another organsiation, we recommend you use a custom query to connect to BigQuery.
You can do this in Looker Studio by:

1. Clicking to [add a data source](https://support.google.com/looker-studio/answer/6300774?hl=en)
2. In the ‘Connect to data’ panel, selecting ‘BigQuery’
3. In the left-hand menu, selecting ‘Custom query’
4. Entering your billing project ID
5. Entering a query to select the fields needed using a WHERE statement to define the date range required (see example below)
6. Tick the checkbox to 'enable date range parameters'
7. Selecting ‘Add’ 

An example of a SQL query that could be used in step 5 above is: 

```SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `ga4-analytics-352613.searchconsole_wwwgovuk.searchdata_site_impression`
WHERE data_date BETWEEN PARSE_DATE("%Y%m%d", @DS_START_DATE) AND PARSE_DATE("%Y%m%d", @DS_END_DATE)
```

### Using the data

Once the connection is set up, you should be able to see all the fields available, similar to how you would see and use any other dataset.
