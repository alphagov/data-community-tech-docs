# Content Data App backfilling

This page contains information on checking and backfilling the Content Data app table in BigQuery.

## Data checking

The following query may help you if you need to check the volume of data in the Content Data table by date.

```sql
SELECT
  the_date,
  sum(unique_page_views)
FROM
  `govuk-content-data.ga4.GA4 dataform`
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY
1 DESC
```

If any dates are missing, there is no data for that date and it will need backfilling.


## Backfilling

The below query will enable you to backfill the Content Data table ('GA4 dataform').
You will need to change the 'YYYYMMDD' in this query to the date you need to query and append the data for.
You can also change this to a `BETWEEN` or `IN` statement.

The data should be appended to the `govuk-content-data.ga4.GA4 dataform` table.

Once the data has been successfully appended (it is best to check this has worked using the checking query above), you will have to notify #govuk-publishing-content-modelling-dev that the data is ready to reimport.
