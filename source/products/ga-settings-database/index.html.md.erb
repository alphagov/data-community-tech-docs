## How the GA Settings Database report works 

### Data sources

The GA Settings Database report uses a custom query which pulls together data from a number of tables in the [GA Settings Database](/data-sources/ga/ga-settings/) dataset:

- the `ga4_accounts` table
- the `ga4_properties` table 
- the `ga4_audiences` table 
- the `ga4_data_streams` table 

The query selects fields from each table and joins them on the date and on account/property IDs.
The query also selects the Looker Studio date range parameters as distinct dimensions so they can be used in calculated fields.
All tables are filtered by the Looker Studio date parameters.

The custom query is as follows:
