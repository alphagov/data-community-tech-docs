# GOV.UK historic data report

The [GOV.UK historic data report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/833939e2-2cfb-4ed3-a202-90498bf9daff/page/p_fg5xyapmid) displays historic Universal Analytics (UA) data in tables that contain similar information to the old Universal Analytics interface. The data in the report runs from 6th April 2021 to 30th June 2024.

The report is split into several pages, with the sections down the left hand side designed to mirror the old UA interface. Within each section you will find individual report pages which again have been designed to mimic the old UA interface.

The last section in the report called ‘References’ contains screenshots of the original report pages in the UA interface for comparison.

## Using the GOV.UK Historic Data Dashboard

### Get access to the GOV.UK Historic Data Dashboard

The [report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/833939e2-2cfb-4ed3-a202-90498bf9daff/page/p_fg5xyapmid) can be viewed by anyone with a @digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk email address. You can share the report simply by sending the URL to others. If you require higher access for any reason, please contact the Analytics team who can grant you this or otherwise help you get what you need.

Those without an @digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk email address will not be able to view this report at the moment. We are working on a solution to better enable access to historic UA data for public sector workers outside of GDS. For the time being, those outside of GDS will have to query the UA data in BigQuery.

It can be edited by anyone in the GDS performance analysts Google group.

### Data quality notes

The filters which were applied to the Main view of the www.gov.uk UA property have not been replicated in this dashboard. This will lead to differing figures in some places. If you have questions about any of the data you see in this report, please get in touch with the Analytics team.

## How the GOV.UK historic data report works

### Data sources

The GOV.UK historic data report draws Universal Analytics data from BigQuery, specifically from the `govuk-bigquery-analytics` project, and the `FlattenedDailyData` dataset. Within this dataset, there are a series of flattened tables containing UA data, which is what this report uses.

### Custom Looker Studio queries

Because the dashboard required many calculated fields and dimensions not natively available in the raw UA data, each page has its own custom query written in Looker Studio. Each custom query is specific to the dimensions and metrics required to replicate the report page in question.

Should the dashboard need to be modified or recreated, these custom queries should be fairly straightforward to decipher. They all share the same FROM and WHERE clause values, referencing the flattened UA data, and using the built-in `@DS_START_DATE` and `@DS_END_DATE` date variables in Looker Studio: 

```SQL
FROM `govuk-bigquery-analytics.FlattenedDailyData.flattened_daily_ga_data_*` 
  WHERE
     _table_suffix BETWEEN @DS_START_DATE
     AND @DS_END_DATE
```
The custom queries are as follows:

#### Audience - Overview page

```SQL
SELECT
date,
language,
CASE 
  WHEN newVisits = 1 THEN 'New Visitor'
  WHEN newVisits IS NULL THEN 'Returning Visitor'
END AS user_type,

COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitStartTime AS STRING))) as sessions,
count(bounces) as bounce_count,
COUNT(CASE WHEN type = 'PAGE' THEN 1 END) AS page_count,
sum(timeonsite/hits) as session_time_seconds,
FROM `govuk-bigquery-analytics.FlattenedDailyData.flattened_daily_ga_data_*`
