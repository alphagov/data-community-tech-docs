# GOV.UK GA4 usage report

The [GOV.UK GA4 usage report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/80a90704-5cad-410c-96a5-1921415892b1/page/PQpTD) shows access to our GOV.UK GA4 Production data and the tokens consumed per user. Access and tokens can be split out by access mechanism and report type. 

The report is split into several pages, which can be accessed from the menu on the left hand side. The pages share the same data source and split the data by various dimensions.

By using this report we can monitor how frequently users are accessing GOV.UK GA4 data, and also how many API tokens they are consuming.

## How the GOV.UK GA4 usage report works

### Data sources

The GA4 usage report uses the `ga4_logs` table in the `ga4_logs` dataset as its data source.
This can be found in the `ga4-analytics-352613` project within BigQuery.

### Cloud function

The GOV.UK GA4 access logs data is generated by querying the Google Analytics Admin API - it is this data which populates the `ga4_logs` table. 

The cloud function is triggered from cloud scheduler and retrieves data once a day, getting fields such as the timestamp and user email, along with metrics for the access count and api tokens consumed, both of which are used in the dashboardâ€™s charts to calculate the number of times a user has accessed GOV.UK GA4 data. Alongside this, the access mechanism is also returned which allows us to report on which method the user used to access the data, e.g. the GA4 interface, Looker Studio etc.

More information about how the `ga4_logs` table is populated using cloud functions can be found on the [data source page]](/data-sources/ga/ga4-logs/#ga4-access-logs).
