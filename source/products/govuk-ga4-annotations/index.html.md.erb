# GOV.UK GA4 annotations
The [GOV.UK GA4 annotations report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/306f1e28-a2c1-4d3a-b03c-ae03ac0c9484) provides information on users of GOV.UK GA4 data to [SPOCs](/processes/ga-access/spocs/).

The data provided includes:

- the dates of changes to the GOV.UK GA4 data collection
- the dates of external events which could impact use of GOV.UK

This report was first created in mid 2024 by the GOV.UK Insights and Analytics team to support users of the GOV.UK GA4 data.

### GOV.UK GA4 annotations data definitions

| Field name | Definition | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| start_date | The date the issue happened or started on |  |
| end_date | If present, the date the issue was resolved or stopped occuring | Only present for annotations pulled from the `data_quality_notes` table |
| category | The type of annotation - for example, if the annotation provides 'Information' or tells you when something was 'Changed', 'Created' or 'Broken' | Always 'Information' for the `govuk_timeline` and `planning_message_calendar` tables |
| issue_name | The 'title' of the issue | Calculated in the custom query for the `govuk_timeline` and `planning_message_calendar` tables |
| details | A more detailed explanation of the issue | Calculated in the custom query for the `govuk_timeline` and `planning_message_calendar` tables |
| duration | The difference between the start and end dates | A calculated field added to the data source |
| impacted_event_names | The event_name value for the GOV.UK GA4 events that might be impacted by this issue - 'null' if all events or unknown | Always 'null' for the `govuk_timeline` and `planning_message_calendar` tables |
| impacted_event_types | The type value for the GOV.UK GA4 events that might be impacted by this issue - 'null' if all events or unknown | Always 'null' for the `govuk_timeline` and `planning_message_calendar` tables |
| Record Count | A count of the records (rows) in the table | Default Looker Studio field |

## How the GOV.UK GA4 annotations report works 

### Data sources

The GOV.UK GA4 annotations reporting Looker Studio report uses the 'GOV.UK GA4 annotations' data source.
This is a custom query which pulls together data from a few different data sources in the `ga4_annotations` dataset:

- the `data_quality_notes` table, which pulls information on changes to the GA4 data collection from a Google Sheet 
- the `govuk_timeline` and `planning_message_calendar` tables, which pull information on external events from two Google Sheets

The custom query unions each of these tables together after adding in the 'Category' and 'Issue name' fields and ensuring that only appropriate rows (where events have specific dates) are pulled in.

Date range parameters are enabled and the whole data source (the result of the union of the above tables) is filtered by the Looker Studio date parameters.

The custom query is as follows:
