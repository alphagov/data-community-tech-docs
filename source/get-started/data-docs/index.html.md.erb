# Editing the Data Community technical documentation

<span style="color:red">This page is a work in progress.</span>

This page contains guidance on the formatting options that can be used when adding content to this site.

## Markdown

### Block formatting options

Headings are added using hashes to signify the heading level - for example, `## Heading 2` for a h2.
You can see examples of headings in use on this page - the h1 as the page title, and h2 and h3 above this paragraph.

Code styling can be used in headings if need be but does alter the perceived size of the text.

> Blockquotes can be added using a '\>' chevron/greater than symbol at the start of a line.

```
Code blocks can be added by bracketing the lines of code with three backticks (`).
```

---

Horizontal rules can be added using `---` and render as above.

Tables are constructing using pipes and dashes. An example can be seen in the next section.

An empty line must be left either side of list items for them to render correctly.
This is an ordered list:

1. ordered list item 1
1. ordered list item 2. Also numbered '1' in the code but rendered as item 2 regardless.

This is an unordered list:

- unordered list item 1
- unordered list item 2

### Inline formatting

There are many more comprehensive guides to markdown online, but key elements used frequently include:

| Element | Markdown syntax | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| *Italic* | \*italicised text\* | --- | 
| **Bold** | \*\*bold text\*\* | --- | 
| `Code` | \`code\` | --- | 
| [Link](/) | \[title\](https://www.example.com) | --- | 

### Markdown that does not work

==Highlighting== text does not appear to do anything.

## CSS styling

CSS formatting can also be written in-line using the HTML style attribute to change the appearance of text.
For example, when indicating that a page is a work-in-progress, we add CSS to change the colour to highlight the message: `<span style="color:red">This page is a work in progress.</span>`.

CSS formatting should be used sparingly - only when it helps to communicate meaning - as some custom CSS could make the site less accessible.

The below table contains some examples of how styles can be used.

| Element | CSS | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| <span style="color:red">Red text</span> | `color:red` | --- | 
| <span style="background-color:yellow">Yellow background</span> | `background-color:yellow` | --- | 
| <span style="bgcolor="#28b463"">Green background</span> | `bgcolor="#28b463"` | --- |
