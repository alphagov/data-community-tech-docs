# Set up your local machine

When you join the GOV.UK Data Services team, you must ensure your local machine is set up correctly, and that you are in the right Google groups.

## Set up your local machine

If you are a new member of technical staff (a developer, data scientist, or an analyst), you will need to set up your machine.
If you are not expecting to do any work requiring coding, or access to AWS or GitHub, you can ignore this step.

To set up your local machine, follow the [Get started on GOV.UK documentation](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html).

Once you have set up your local machine by following this documentation, you should have access to GitHub and AWS.

## Join Google Groups

You should join various Google Groups to be able to access group emails and calendars. To join any of the Google Groups linked below, select the link, and then select __Ask to join group__.
If a Group is not linked below, ask your delivery manager to help you gain access.
