# New starter onboarding - Performance Analysis

The below covers a variety of information that will be useful to all those joining the [performance analysis](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2014/12/01/time-for-a-rebrand-product-analysts-become-performance-analysts/) community in the Government Digital Service.
The wider [reference information in this section](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/get-started/reference-info/#reference-information) will also be useful, so please do consult that as well.

Remember that it is [it's ok to say what's ok](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/).

## Things to do when you join GDS

When you join GDS as a performance analyst, please make sure to:

- join the #analysis Slack channel 
- get access to the Performance Analysts calendar (ask a Lead Performance Analyst to invite you), and come along to the weekly community hours
- learn about what it is like to work as a performance analyst embedded in a multidisciplinary team - [read this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-G6DRgyPggrX6w79HrXKeIYA7M7Kyc15g9C9KHZSi0/) and talk to your line manager 
- learn about [performance frameworks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G-25i8blEtwUSUsV18pL61AoFih7ZdMWMBsBZTqeDgw/)
- get familiar with our weeknotes, and contribute your updates at the end of every week

## Tools for analysts

Key tools that analysts will use are:

- Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- Looker Studio

Make sure you have access to the right GA4 data sources for your role. Ask your line manager or other performance analysts if you are unsure about whether you have the right access.

Other tools some analysts in the community use and find useful include:

- [Omnibug](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/omnibug/bknpehncffejahipecakbfkomebjmokl)
