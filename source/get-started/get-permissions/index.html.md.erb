# Assume a specific role in AWS

GDS maintains a central account for AWS access.

You must have access to this GDS account to work with the [govuk-aws repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws) and the [govuk-aws-data repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws-data).

As a data community member, you need to assume a specific role in AWS. For example, an `admin` or `datascienceuser` role.

1. [Get AWS access](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#8-get-aws-access) as part of [getting started on GOV.UK](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#header).

1. Go to the appropriate environment in the [`infra-security` folder in the `govuk-aws-data` repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws-data/tree/main/data/infra-security) and open a pull request.

1. Open the `common.tfvars` file, and add your information to the appropriate `role_<ROLE>_user_arns` list.

    For example, if you are John Smith and you want to assume the `admin` role, you would add `"arn:aws:iam::622626885786:user/john.smith@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk"` to the `role_admin_user_arns` list.

1. Save and merge the pull request.

See the [Get access to integration infrastructure documentation](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#get-access-to-integration-infrastructure) for another example of this process.
