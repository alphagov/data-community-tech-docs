# Set up AWS CLI to assume roles with MFA and interact with GDS AWS

Here we go through how to set up `aws cli` to assume an AWS IAM Role that has permissions your AWS user account does not have (for instance, accessing `S3`). It assumes that MFA is also required.

Assuming a role means that the AWS token service will give you **temporary credentials** to access the (GDS) AWS account with an assumed role. 


## GDS AWS Requirements

1. Ensure you have access to GDS AWS Account. Follow these instructions if you have not already done so as part of your onboarding: [GDS - Get AWS Access](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#8-get-aws-access). At the end, you will have created your AWS IAM user account, and also received an AWS `access key ID` and `secret access key`.

2. Get [STS Permission to AssumeRole with MFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_permissions-to-switch.html) for the role you want to assume. 

    For instance, if you are a Data Scientist in CPTO, you may want to assume the [`govuk-datascienceusers` IAM Role](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=eu-west-1#/roles/details/govuk-datascienceusers?section=permissions). Ask on the `#data-engineering` Slack channel to get this permission.


## Set up AWS CLI

3. Ensure you have `aws cli` installed. It should have gotten installed as part of step 1. To verify, in your terminal run:

```shell
which aws
aws --version
```
If it is not available, please [follow the official installation instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

4. Configure `aws cli`. In your terminal, run:

```shell
aws configure
```
and follow the prompts. NOTE: you will be asked to provide your AWS `access key ID` and `secret access key` so have them ready.
Please also provide `eu-west-1` when asked for `region`.

Your credentials should have now been added to the `~/.aws/credentials` file, under a `[default]` profile.

5. Create a profile for the role you want to assume in your `~/.aws/config`. If the file does not exist, you'll need to create it. In your `~/.aws/config` file, add:

    ```
    [profile <PROFILE-ALIAS>]
    source_profile = default
    role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<ROLE ACCOUNT NUM>:role/<ROLE NAME>
    mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<YOUR USER ACCOUNT NUMBER>:mfa/<YOUR NAME>.<YOUR SURNAME>@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
    ```

    choosing a suitable `<PROFILE-ALIAS>` and substituting the correct values for `<ROLE ACCOUNT NUM>`, `<ROLE NAME>`, `<YOUR USER ACCOUNT NUMBER>`, `<YOUR NAME>` and `<YOUR SURNAME>`.


    For instance, to create a profile for the `govuk-datascienceusers` so that we can assume that role with MFA, in the `~/.aws/config` file, add:

    ```
    [profile govuk-datascience]
    source_profile = default
    role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<ROLE ACCOUNT NUM>:role/govuk-datascienceusers
    mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::<YOUR USER ACCOUNT NUMBER>:mfa/<YOUR NAME>.<YOUR SURNAME>@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
    ```

You can now assume the `govuk-datascienceusers` role and its permissions to interact with AWS S3 
by adding `--profile govuk-datascience` at the end of your `aws cli` commands.

For instance:
    ```shell
    aws s3 ls --profile govuk-datascience
    ```

### Note

- You will be asked to provide a `MFA token` the first time you use the profile and when the temporary credentials have expired and new ones will need to be generated.
- Your temporary credentials get saved in: `~/.aws/cli/cache`.
