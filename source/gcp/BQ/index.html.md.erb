# BigQuery

This section contains guidance on using BigQuery, often shortened to BQ.

## Access
When requesting access please state what data you need access to. If in doubt try the #data-engineering slack channel. 


## Quotas
Several projects have quotas set up to limit the amount of data that can be queried. 
The aim of this is twofold, firstly it limits our exposure to unlimited costs from queries.
Secondly it provides a safety net for those working with the data, you can only wrack up so much in query costs.

The aim is not to be a hinderance to the need to use the data we store so please contact the #data-engineering slack channel to discuss your needs if the quotas are getting in the way of work.


### How come I went over my quota
This is a very good question that we are still investigating.

Our current thinking is that the dynamic concurrent query queue could be loaded with queries before the quota is breached.
We think that the quota check occurs before a query is moved to Active.

### Why is Looker so data hungry
Another good question that is under investigation.

Currently Looker does not cache results from BQ, meaning the query has to be run every time. 
Caching results is due for general availability release
(Link to Google documentation)[https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/visualize-looker-studio.md#looker-studio-integration]

In addition to not caching results it seems that when creating a new data connection, Looker connects to a sharded set of tables for the first time it runs a series of queries that reference all shards.
The queries are for a small number fields each (4 or 5) and then query all shards and then include a `LIMIT 100` and this is done multiple times untli all fields are done.
This is essentially a `SELECT * FROM * LIMIT 100`.

This does not appear to be the case when using an existing data connection and Looker respects the table_suffix and default date range within the report.

USE SHARED PRE EXISTING DATA CONNECTIONS IN LOOKER

## Roles
Google Cloud Platform permissions (IAM) can be a mysterious thing.

BigQuery Data Viewer at the Project level allows the person to see all the data held within a project, it can also be applied at a dataset level. 
It does not provide the ability to query the data from that project, they would need to do so from a different project.


BigQuery Job User grants the user the ability to run queries from the project. The data could be held in a different project but the query cost it allocated to the querying project.


BigQuery Read Session User is needed if the Storage Read API is used when querying
