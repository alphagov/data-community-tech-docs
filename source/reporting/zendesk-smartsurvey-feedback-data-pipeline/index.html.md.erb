# Feedback data processing pipeline

GOV.UK users can provide feedback about GOV.UK by selecting the:

- __Is this page useful? Yes or No__ button on a GOV.UK page to provide qualitative feedback about their experience on GOV.UK
- __Report a problem__ button on a GOV.UK page to report issues with that page
- __Contact__ link in a GOV.UK page footer to go to a service-specific contact page to leave written feedback

These feedback methods appear on all GOV.UK pages.

The Data Insights team collects and organises feedback data from multiple sources to make that data available to GDS users for analysis.

The feedback data processing pipeline is separated into 3 stages:

- read the feedback data into the pipeline from the data sources
- process the feedback data to make it ready for analysis
- analyse the feedback data

The following content explains how each stage of this pipeline works.

## Read the feedback data into the pipeline

Feedback data is stored in one of the following data sources, depending on the route through which users submitted feedback:

- [SmartSurvey](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/), which stores the __Is this page useful?__ survey results
- the [Support API](https://github.com/alphagov/support-api), which store both the Report a problem issue descriptions and Contact request details

Every day, the pipeline reads the previous day's data from the 2 data sources and stores that data in the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) as a raw text file.

The pipeline does not do any processing or transformation of data at this stage.

## Process the feedback data

The pipeline processes the feedback data from the 2 data sources to make it ready for analysis.

The data processing is the same regardless of the data source, and consists of several steps.

### Read the data into the pipeline

The pipeline reads the raw text data file from the Google Cloud Platform into the pipeline programming environment in Python.

### Structure the data

The data from SmartSurvey and the Support API are structured differently, but share characteristics such as prompt-response pairs and metadata about the feedback.

The pipeline changes the format of the data from both data sources to be consistent with one another and to adhere to the required output data format.

### Remove whitespace from the data

Pruning is a data cleansing method that removes nonsensical or irrelevant feedback text from a feedback data record.

Examples of pruning include trimming whitespace and removing URL parameters or code snippets.

In this step, the pipeline prunes whitespace from the beginning and end of the feedback data text.

The pipeline also searches from multiple consecutive whitespaces in feedback data text, and reduces those to one space if it finds any.

### Remove profanity from the data

Masking replaces a portion of feedback text with a text mask indicating the feedback text has been modified.

An example of a text mask is `****`.

In this step, the pipeline searches for and replaces any profane words in the feedback text with the mask pattern of `****`.

### Remove PII from the data

The pipeline sends the feedback data to the [Google Cloud Data Loss Prevention service (DLP)](https://cloud.google.com/dlp).

Google Cloud DLP looks for the following information types:

```
info_types = [
    'DATE_OF_BIRTH',
    'EMAIL_ADDRESS',
    'PASSPORT',
    'PERSON_NAME',
    'PHONE_NUMBER',
    'STREET_ADDRESS',
    'UK_NATIONAL_INSURANCE_NUMBER',
    'UK_PASSPORT',
    'CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER',
    'IBAN_CODE',
    'IP_ADDRESS',
    'MEDICAL_TERM',
    'VEHICLE_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER',
    'SCOTLAND_COMMUNITY_HEALTH_INDEX_NUMBER',
    'UK_DRIVERS_LICENSE_NUMBER',
    'UK_NATIONAL_HEALTH_SERVICE_NUMBER',
    'UK_TAXPAYER_REFERENCE',
    'SWIFT_CODE'
]
```

Google Cloud DLP then masks any instances of feedback data text that matches these information types, and returns the cleansed data to the pipeline.

### Nest the data values and group the data

A single feedback record may contain multiple prompt-response pairs. For example, a single record may have the following pairs:

- "What was the problem?" "The link to the PDF did not work"
- "Were there any other issues?" "No"

In the feedback data set, every prompt-response pair would have a feedback record with meta data about the record. For example:

|Date|Time|URL|Prompt|Response|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|2022-07-27|12:34:56|https://www.gov.uk/examplefeedback.html|What was the problem?|The link to the PDF did not work|
|2022-07-27|12:34:56|https://www.gov.uk/examplefeedback.html|Were there any other issues?|No|

This means that there is a lot of duplication in the feedback data set.

In this step, the pipeline nests the data values and groups the data to remove the feedback record metadata duplication.

Now there is one feedback record for the multiple prompt-response pairs that relate to that feedback record. For example:

|Date|Time|URL|Prompt|Response|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|2022-07-27|12:34:56|https://www.gov.uk/examplefeedback.html|What was the problem?|The link to the PDF did not work|
||||Were there any other issues?|No|

The pipeline has finished processing the data.

### Save the processed feedback data

The pipeline saves the processed data into the `govuk_user_feedback` table in the `govuk-bigquery-analytics` BigQuery project.

To request permission to view or edit these data tables in BigQuery, speak to the GDS Data Products team on the [#govuk-data-labs Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T8GT9416G/CHR4UQKU4).

The Support API and SmartSurvey feedback data is now ready for users to view and analyse in BigQuery.

## Data field definitions

All data fields in BigQuery are text strings.
