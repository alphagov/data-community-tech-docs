# GOV.UK Publishing GA4 BigQuery Processing

## Publishing’s raw BigQuery data

We export our GOV.UK Publishing Google Analytics data and store it in Google BigQuery to enable more detailed analysis than is possible in the GA4 user interface. This data can also be queried and used in other tools.

From the ‘raw’ exported data, a flattened dataset is also created. This contains most of the same fields as the raw data and is easier and more efficient to query, so should be used for most analysis and reporting.

In the `govuk-publishing` project we have both flattened sharded and flattened partitioned data available, depending on what the user would prefer to access or query. Using the flattened partitioned table will be the best option in most cases, so we would recommend using this table where possible. 

### Location

There are 2 raw Publishing GA4 datasets, which correspond to the integration and production environments. All of these datasets are in the govuk-publishing project. These datasets are:

- the `govuk-publishing.analytics_400020090 dataset`, which holds publishing’s raw GA4 production data 
- the `govuk-publishing.analytics_414850201 dataset`, which holds publishing’s raw GA4 integration data 

These datasets are both comprised of date sharded tables - a new table is created each day with the suffix YYYYMMDD.

### Set-up

#### Data collection and processing

As with the GOV.UK website data, our Google Analytics properties export GOV.UK Publishing data several times a day. The data for the current day is temporarily stored in intraday tables. At the end of the day, BigQuery automatically moves the data in the intraday tables to a date table (suffixed YYYYMMDD) and deletes the intraday tables in question. New intraday tables are created and added to throughout the next day.

#### Schema

These tables use the default [GA4 BigQuery Export schema](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7029846):

## Publishing’s processed BigQuery data

### Publishing GA4 flattened data

Publishing’s GA4 flattened data refers to our production GA4 data processed into a flat format.

Publishing’s GA4 data is flattened in two places: a set of sharded tables (one table for each day), and a flattened partition table (all dates are combined into one big partitioned table). Users may use whichever data source they wish, but for most applications we would recommend using the flattened partitioned table, as this will be more efficient and easier to query than other data sources. This also aligns us with the primary GA4 data source as used for the main GOV.UK website which has its own flattened partitioned table in the `ga4-analytics-352613` project. As such, this documentation will refer specifically to publishing’s flattened partitioned data rather than the sharded tables.

### Content and change record

The first date for which there is data in the flattened partitioned table is the 1st January 2025. This is because the quality of earlier data may be lower than desired before this point. 

The flattened partitioned table is partitioned on `event_date`. A `WHERE` clause to specify which partitions are needed is required when querying this table - for example, `WHERE event_date = "2024-09-12"`.

As of 2025, our GA4 implementation is still in active development, and we have developed a [dashboard to track significant data changes](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/9fc96af9-978f-4ad8-8c9e-9b73a58a9fe2/page/HEYTF) in our Publishing GA4 change record to help users understand when certain elements were introduced or changed.

### Location

This data can be found in BigQuery in the `govuk-publishing.dataform.partitioned_flattened_events` table.

As with the rest of our GA4 publishing BigQuery data, this is located in the `govuk-publishing project`. 

### Set-up

#### Data collection and processing

This flattened table is the result of several steps of processing:

1. The GA4 publishing production raw data is received from Google. This arrives sharded into daily tables, and the data within these tables is nested. We store this raw data in BigQuery.

2. The raw data is processed into a partitioned table that is partitioned on `event_date` and clustered on `event_name` (though the data is still nested).

3. The partitioned nested data is flattened into the partitioned flattened table detailed on this page.

mermaid.initialize({ 
    startOnLoad: true,
    theme: 'base',
    themeVariables: {
        mainBkg: '#ffffff',
        primaryColor: '#f3f2f1',
        primaryTextColor: '#0b0c0c',
        secondaryTextColor: '#505a5f'
    } 
    });
</script>

This processing occurs within DataForm in the same project (`govuk-publishing`). The DataForm script is compiled at 7am UTC and is run several times throughout the day to ensure the data is processed soon after it arrives.

For more information about the processing, this process mirrors that which is used for GOV.UK’s GA4 data, and more information can be found [here](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/#gov-uk-ga4-flattened-table), which also links to the code itself on github.
