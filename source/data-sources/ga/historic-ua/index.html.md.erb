# Historic GOV.UK analytics (UA) data
The previous version of Google Analytics, Universal Analytics, was sunset at the end of June 2024.
Before this sunset, we exported several of our GOV.UK Universal Analytics properties' data and stored it in Google BigQuery.
This data can be used for more long-term analysis.

Guidance on how to use this can be found in the [analysis section](/analysis/ga-ua-data/).

## Content

There are several historic UA datasets. These include:

- [UA data for www.gov.uk](/data-sources/ga/ua/)
- UA data for the GOV.UK blog platform
- UA data for goverment publishing apps and sites
- UA data for other GDS-owned product sites

## Access
To be granted access to this data, please contact the [GA4 support inbox](mailto:govuk-ga4-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

### Location
Most of the GDS historic Google Analytics datasets are stored in BigQuery in the `gds-ga-archive` project.

See the page on our [GCP projects](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-projects/#gds-ga-archive) for information on the quotas applicable here. 

## Schema
The [UA BigQuery Export schema](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en) defines the schema of these tables.
