The UA flattened tables contain [GOV.UK Universal Analytics](/data-sources/ga/ua/) data processed into a flat format.

## Access
Everyone with a @digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk account (all GDS staff) has access to the data.

### Location
This is stored in BigQuery in the dataset `govuk-bigquery-analytics.FlattenedDailyData`.
Each daily table is sharded in the format flattened_daily_ga_data_YYYYMMDD.
