# GA4 (BigQuery export) 
This is the Google Analytics data on usage of GOV.UK, exported from Google Analytics 4, stored in Google BigQuery.

A [flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/) is created from the data on the live site which contains most, but not all, of the same fields.
The flattened dataset is easier and more efficient to query, so should be used for most analysis and reporting.

## Access
Everyone with a @digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk account has access to this data by default.

Access to GA4 for data users across government is currently limited to an early access group. For more details, see our blog on [Sharing data and lessons from our Google Analytics 4 upgrade](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2023/03/27/sharing-data-and-lessons-from-our-google-analytics-4-upgrade/).

### Location
There are 3 GA4 datasets. These correspond to the integration, staging, and production or live GOV.UK websites.
All of these datasets are made up of sharded tables. This means that a new table is created each day with the suffix YYYYMMDD.

The GA4 data for the live GOV.UK site is located in BigQuery in the `ga4-analytics-352613.analytics_330577055` dataset.
The GA4 data for the staging site is located in BigQuery in the `ga4-analytics-352613.analytics_330580593` dataset.
The GA4 data for the integration site is located in BigQuery in the `ga4-analytics-352613.analytics_294475112` dataset.

These datasets are all within the [GA4 analytics project](/gcp/#ga4-analytics).
For more information on the Google Cloud Platform projects, see our [GCP Project Documentation](/gcp/).
