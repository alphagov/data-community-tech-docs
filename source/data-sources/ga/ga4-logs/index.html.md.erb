# GA4 access logs
The GA4 access logs data details usage of the [GOV.UK Google Analytics GA4 data](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) via the Google Analytics Data API.
This includes usage of the GOV.UK GA4 user interface and Looker Studio connections, as well as direct querying of the API, but does not include usage of the data [exported to BigQuery](/data-sources/ga/ga4-bq/).

## Access
Access to the dataset is limited to GA4 user admins, but reporting 

[Summarised data is also provided to SPOCs](/products/govuk-ga4-spocs/) for their department.

### Location
The data is located in BigQuery under the `ga4-analytics-352613.ga4_logs` dataset, in the [GA4 Analytics project](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-projects/#ga4-analytics).

The data is sharded, with a table created each day with the date as a suffix (in the format YYYYMMDD).

## Set-up
### Data collection
This data is generated by querying the [Google Analytics Admin API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1/access-api).
A Google Cloud Run function is triggered by a Cloud Scheduler job to run every day at 6am, retrieving the data and appending it to the `ga4_logs` table in the dataset mentioned above.
