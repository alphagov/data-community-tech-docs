# GOV.UK GA4 access logs
The GOV.UK GA4 access logs data details usage of the [GOV.UK Google Analytics GA4 data](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) via the Google Analytics Data API.
This includes usage of the GOV.UK GA4 user interface and Looker Studio connections, as well as direct querying of the API, but does not include usage of the data [exported to BigQuery](/data-sources/ga/ga4-bq/).

## Content
Data was first collected into this dataset on the 18th July 2023.

The fields in this dataset and their descriptions can be seen in the [schema table below](/data-sources/ga/ga4-logs/#schema).

## Access
Access to the BigQuery dataset is limited to GA4 user admins. 
However, the [GA4 usage report](/products/ga4-usage-dashboard/) which visualises this data is shared with all GDS performance analysts and the Data Services Google group.

[Summarised data is also provided to SPOCs](/products/govuk-ga4-spocs/) for their department.

### Location
The data is located in BigQuery under the `ga4-analytics-352613.ga4_logs` dataset, in the [GA4 Analytics project](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-projects/#ga4-analytics).

The data is partitioned on the `epoch_time_micros` timestamp.

## Set-up
### Data collection
This data is generated by querying the [Google Analytics Admin API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1/access-api).
A Google Cloud Run function is triggered by a Cloud Scheduler job to run every day at 6am, retrieving the data and appending it to the `ga4_logs` table in the dataset mentioned above.
