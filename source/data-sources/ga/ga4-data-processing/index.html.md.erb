# GA4 Data Processing

The raw data we get from Google Analytics is processed to make it more useful for our needs. Specifically we transform the data from sharded tables to a partitioned table and also flatten the data from it's initial nested structure.

The processing takes place in the Google Cloud Project `https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=gds-bq-reporting` using Dataform.

A link to the specific Dataform repository is here: https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/ga4_production_partitioning/details/workspaces?project=gds-bq-reporting


## Sharded to Partitioned tables

This process takes a date sharded table (ending YYYYMMDD) and copies it as a new partition into `ga4-analytics-352613.analytics_330577055.partitioned_events`.
The partitioning is done on `event_date` which means that this field is transformed from a string into a timestamp. The table is also clustered on `event_name`


## Flattened table creation

The flattened GA4 data is created from the partitioned table and it is also partitioned on `event_date` and clustered on `event_name` and is saved as `ga4-analytics-352613.flattened_dataset.partitioned_flattened_events`


## Re-running the pipeline

To perform a manual execution click on the start execution button here https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/dataform/locations/europe-west2/repositories/ga4_production_partitioning/details/release-scheduling?project=gds-bq-reporting and select the Production release configuration and all actions to run.

## Updating the Partitioned table schema

Occasionally Google will change the schema of the data it sends to BigQuery. This will cause the processing to fail.
To update the schema run the following:

This command produces a schema file based on what Google is now sending, change YYYYMMDD to reflect yesterday

`bq show schema format=prettyjson ga4-analytics-352613:analytics_330577055.events_YYYYMMDD > new_schema.json`

You will then need to change the `event_date` to a `DATE` and save the modified file.

`bq update ga4-analytics-352613:analytics_330577055.partitioned_events new_schema.json`

Then see the steps on re running the pipeline above.
