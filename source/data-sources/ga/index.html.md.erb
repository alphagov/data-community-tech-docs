# Google Analytics

Google Analytics is the tool we use to collect data from users about how they use our digital products and services.

## Accounts and properties

Google Analytics properties - the datasets associated with a given tracking code/measurement ID - are grouped under accounts.

In the Government Digital Service, we have a number of accounts, grouping properties by the function of the websites they correspond to or the directorate that owns them.
Key accounts include:

- 'www.gov.uk' - under which properties related to the 'main' www.gov.uk site (including development websites) and GOV.UK App sit
- 'GDS - GOV.UK - Publishing' - under which properties related to the GOV.UK Publishing apps sit
- 'GOV.UK - Blogs' - which houses the [GOV.UK Blogs property](./blogs-ga4/)

Access at account level is generally restricted to named users with specific needs and certain senior performance analysts with admin roles.
The majority of access is granted at property level.
