# Google Analytics

Google Analytics is the tool we use to collect data from users about how they use our digital tools.


## 360
360 is Google's premium tier and the one the GDS use. 

All accounts and properties should be created at this tier.
This is to ensure data collected is covered by our 360 contract terms.

If you have created a new GDS Google Analytics property and need to upgrade it to 360, please contact the Analytics team.
