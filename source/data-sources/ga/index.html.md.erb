# Google Analytics

Google Analytics is the tool we use to collect data from users about how they use our digital products and services.

## Accounts and properties

Google Analytics properties - the datasets associated with a given tracking code/measurement ID - are grouped under accounts.

In the Government Digital Service, we have a number of accounts, grouping properties by the function of the websites they correspond to or the directorate that owns them.
Key accounts include:

- 'www.gov.uk' - under which properties related to the 'main' www.gov.uk site (including development websites) and GOV.UK app sit
- 'GDS - GOV.UK - Publishing' - under which properties related to the GOV.UK Publishing apps sit
- 'GOV.UK - Blogs' - which houses the [GOV.UK Blogs property](./blogs-ga4/)

Access at account level is generally restricted to named users with specific needs and certain senior performance analysts with admin roles.
The majority of access is granted at property level.

## 360
360 is Google's premium or enterprise tier. GDS has an active 360 contract.

All GDS GA4 properties should be created at this tier.
This is to ensure data collected is covered by our 360 contract terms.

Google Analytics 360 also has a number of advantages over the free tier, providing higher limits on data collection, reporting, retention, and export to BigQuery.
More information on the differences between free Google Analytics and Google Analytics 360 can be found on Google's [support pages](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11202874).

If you have created a new GDS Google Analytics property and need to upgrade it to 360, please contact the Analytics team.
