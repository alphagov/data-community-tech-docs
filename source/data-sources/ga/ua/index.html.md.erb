# GOV.UK Universal Analytics (BigQuery export)
From 2014 to 2024, we used Universal Analytics (UA) to collect analytics data on GOV.UK.

We are currently storing this historic GOV.UK Universal Analytics data in Google BigQuery.
This enables detailed, long-term analysis and the use of GOV.UK UA data by other tools.

## Content

This dataset contains data collected between 2014 and June 2024.

## Access
Everyone with a @digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk account (all GDS staff) has access to the data.

Other public servants can request access to this data - see our [historic data policy](/processes/ga-historic/).

### Location
This data is stored in BigQuery in the `govuk-bigquery-analytics.87773428` dataset.
This dataset is made up of sharded tables, where each table is named `YYYYMMDD` after the date that data was collected on in year-month-day format.
Like all of our data, this is located in the europe-west2 GCP region.

For more information on our Google Cloud Platform projects, see our [GCP project documentation](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-projects/#universal-analytics).

## Schema
The [UA BigQuery Export schema](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en) defines the schema of these tables. However, not all columns are filled in our tables.
