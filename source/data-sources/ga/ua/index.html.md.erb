# GOV.UK Universal Analytics (BigQuery export)
We export our GOV.UK Universal Analytics data and store it in Google BigQuery.
This enables more detailed analysis and the use of GOV.UK UA data by other tools.

Universal Analytics (UA) sends GOV.UK visitor journey data to the `govuk-bigquery-analytics.87773428.ga_sessions_intraday_YYYYMMDD` table 3 times a day, where:

- `govuk-bigquery-analytics` is the project ID
- `87773428` is the dataset name
- `ga_sessions_intraday_YYYYMMDD` is the table name
- `YYYYMMDD` is the current date in year-month-day format

At the end of the day, UA automatically:

- moves the data in this intraday table to a `ga_sessions_YYYYMMDD` table
- deletes this intraday table
- creates a new intraday table for the next day


## Access
Everyone with a @digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk account (all GDS staff) has access to the data.

### Location
This data is stored in BigQuery in the `govuk-bigquery-analytics.87773428` dataset. 
Like all of our data, this is located in the europe-west2 GCP region.

For more information on our Google Cloud Platform projects, see our [GCP project documentation](/gcp/#universal-analytics).

## Schema
The [UA BigQuery Export schema](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en) defines the schema of these tables. However, not all columns are filled in our tables.
