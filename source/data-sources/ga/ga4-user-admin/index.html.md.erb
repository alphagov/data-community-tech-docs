# GOV.UK GA4 user admin tables
<span style="color:red">This page is a work in progress.</span>

The GOV.UK GA4 user admin tables are used to support administration of the [GOV.UK Google Analytics GA4 dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4/).

These tables include:

- the `all_users` table in the dataset created by the [GA4 user admin tool](/tools/ga4-user-admin-tool/#ga4-user-admin-tool) 
- the `user_admin_log` table in the dataset created by the [GA4 user admin tool](/tools/ga4-user-admin-tool/#ga4-user-admin-tool) 
- the `spocs` table in the user admin tool dataset, pulling organisation and [SPOC information](/processes/ga-access/spocs/) from a Google Sheet

## Content
The fields in this dataset and their descriptions can be seen in the [schema table below](/data-sources/ga/ga4-user-admin/#schema).

The data in the `all_users` and `user_admin_log` tables comes from the [GA4 user admin tool](/tools/ga4-user-admin-tool/#ga4-user-admin-tool).

The data in the `spocs` table comes from a Google Sheet used by GOV.UK performance analysts to record departments' [Analytics SPOCs](/processes/ga-access/spocs/).

## Access
Access to the BigQuery dataset is limited to GA4 user admins. 
However, the [GOV.UK GA4 users monitoring report](/products/govuk-ga4-users-monitoring/) which visualises this data is shared with all GDS performance analysts and the GOV.UK Insights and Analytics team Google group.

[Summarised data is also provided to SPOCs](/products/govuk-ga4-spocs/) for their department.

### Location
The data is located in BigQuery under the `ga4-analytics-352613.user_admin` dataset, in the [GA4 Analytics project](/tools/google-cloud-platform/gcp-projects/#ga4-analytics).

## Set-up
### Retention
The `all_users` table is set to expire in February 2026.

The `spocs` table is set to never expire.

The `user_admin_log` table is set to expire in April 2025.
