# GOV.UK GA4 summary tables
Tables of high-level summary metrics are generated from the partitioned_flattened_events table where there is a need to reduce query costs. A list of available tables is below.  

## Access
Everyone with a @digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk email address (all GDS staff) has access to the data by default.

In addition, everyone who requests and is granted access to the GOV.UK GA4 data will be given access to query this flattened dataset. More information can be found in our GA access policy.

### Available tables

| Table | Content | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page Summaries | A table that groups by event date and page location and provides a range of summary metrics. The summary metrics are things like page views, sessions, entrances, exits, searches and page usefulness | [Link to page_summaries](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=gds-bq-processing&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sga4-analytics-352613!2sflattened_dataset!3spage_summaries) |
| Navigation Events | A table that groups by event data and a cleaned version of the page location and filters for navigation events only. The fields in the table are relevant to navigation events such as the link url, the type of page feature the user interacted with and whether it was outbound from GOV.UK or not. The table also includes a couple of summary metrics: a count of the number of times a particular navigation event happened and the number of sessions it happened in | [Link to navigation_events](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=gds-bq-processing&ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sga4-analytics-352613!2sflattened_dataset!3snavigation_events) |
