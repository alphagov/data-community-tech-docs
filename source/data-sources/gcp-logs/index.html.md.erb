# Google Cloud Platform logs

<span style="color:red">This page is a work in progress.</span>

The [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/tools/google-cloud-platform/) logs contain data generated by use of GCP resources. 

## Content
The logs datasets contain the [Cloud Audit logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit), minus any data from services we choose to exclude, exported into a BigQuery dataset.

These datasets are set up for each GCP project individually, and so the history accumulated varies by project.
The `all_gcp_logs` logs - collating logs data across multiple GCP projects - was set up in November 2023.

## Access
Access to this data is limited to GCP admins and analysts who require it for specific use cases.
Contact the #data-engineering Slack channel if you would like access.

### Location
The logs data for each project is stored in the project in a dataset called `gcp_logs`.

Logs data for many of our projects is also routed into a dataset called `all_gcp_logs` in the `gds-bq-reporting` project, which is used to enable analysis and reporting across multiple projects' logs.

## Set-up

To configure the logs, a logs storage bucket is set up in the europe-west2 region with 'Log Analytics' enabled and a BigQuery dataset linked.

For the multi-project `all_gcp_logs` dataset, sinks are set up within the GCP Log router to write the logs from one project into the `multi_project` log bucket in the `gds-bq-reporting` project.

Currently, logs with the IDs `cloudaudit.googleapis.com/activity`, `externalaudit.googleapis.com/activity`, `cloudaudit.googleapis.com/system_event`, `externalaudit.googleapis.com/system_event`, `cloudaudit.googleapis.com/access_transparency`, and `externalaudit.googleapis.com/access_transparency` are excluded from all logs datasets.

### Schema
All of these datasets have the default Cloud Audit logs schema.

## Retention
This data is stored for 1 year.
