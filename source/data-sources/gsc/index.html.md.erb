# Google Search Console

Google Search Console (GSC) provides data on searches that result in a page from a given domain being displayed as part of the Google search results.

Search Console also allows you to remove content items from external search results and clear caches.
These features are used by Technical 2nd line.

The Google Search Console properties with BigQuery exports set up are documented below this page. 
See the documentation for information on the location and content of these datasets, and policies for access:
