# A/B testing in GA4

An A/B test is a type of experiment in which you split your traffic into multiple groups and show each group a different version of your web page or app.
By doing this, you can compare the ways the user groups interact with each version of the page or app to determine which version is the most succesful.
A/B testing can be a useful tool to test the efficacy of design or content changes to a product.

## A/B testing on GOV.UK

There is documentation in the GOV.UK developer docs on [how A/B testing works](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/ab-testing.html) and on [how to run an A/B or multivariate test](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/run-ab-test.html) from the technical perspective.

When developers implement A/B tests, the `"govuk:ab-test"` meta tag will be populated.
The content of this meta tag is picked up and sent to GA4 (and to BigQuery) in the `ab_test` custom parameter, and will appear in GA4 in the 'AB test' custom dimension.
Analysts can use this dimension to obtain and compare metrics for each version of the page being tested.

Note that [the register of A/B tests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4vGXzIbhOWwUzourPLIc8WM-iU1b6WYOVDOZxmU1Uo/edit?gid=254065189#gid=254065189) must be updated whenever an A/B test is run.
