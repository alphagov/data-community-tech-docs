# Analytics SPOCs

Every organisation with access to GOV.UK web analytics data needs to have a nominated analytics Single Point of Contact (SPOC).
The SPOC is responsible for raising requests for user administration.
This includes adding new starters and removing those who no longer need access (such as leavers).

Every SPOC will be provided with reporting to enable them to [monitor their organisation's users' usage](/processes/ga-access/#monitoring-and-reporting).

## How to become a SPOC
The nominated SPOC will need access to Signon. Access to Signon can be arranged by your organisation's content SPOC.

To request a change of SPOC, raise a request via the [Analytics Support Form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/analytics_request/new) stating who the new SPOC will be.
