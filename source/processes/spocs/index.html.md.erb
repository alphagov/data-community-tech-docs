# SPOCS

Every organisation with access to GOV.UK web analyticsÂ data needs to have a nominated analytics Single Point of Contact (SPOC).
This person is responsible for raising requests for user administration. Adding new starters, removing leavers or those who no longer need access.

## How to become a SPOC
TODO: write the process for getting SignOn access?

## Changing SPOC
To request a change of SPOC simply raise a request via the Analytics Support Form via Sign-On [Government Support Form](https://signon.publishing.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in) stating who the new SPOC will be.
