# GOV.UK GA4 new user welcome message

This is the message that should get sent to new users when they are added to GOV.UK GA4.


You have now been added to GOV.UK GA4.

- A reminder - you should not add a Gmail email address as a back-up recovery email. Google will make this your primary login if added, and it's our policy that you must login with your work email address. If a Gmail address is found in our system, your access may be removed without notice. Custom reports/alerts/dashboards will not be recoverable if your account is removed.
- We regularly review account access data. If you do not access your account for over six months, your access may be removed without notice.
