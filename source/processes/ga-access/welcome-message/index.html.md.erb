# GOV.UK GA4 welcome message

This is the message that should get sent to new users when they are granted access to GOV.UK GA4.

## GOV.UK GA4 new user welcome message

**Access**

You now have access to:
- the GOV.UK GA4 Production property (Analyst role)
- GOV.UK GA4 data in BigQuery, flattened and raw (read access)
- GOV.UK Search Console data in BigQuery (read access)

You will not be able to query the data stored in Big Query without access to a billable Google Cloud Platform project.

**Access points**

- The URL of the main GA4 interface is [https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web)
- The key Big Query tables are ‘ga4-analytics-352613.flattened_dataset.partitioned_flattened_events’ and ‘ga4-analytics-352613.searchconsole_wwwgovuk.searchdata_url_impression_click_data_only’

**Tips**

- There is documentation [here](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/analysis/govuk-ga4/) on how GA4 has been configured on GOV.UK, how it differs from Universal Analytics and how to use it.
- There is also documentation on the structure of the [GA4 table](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/#gov-uk-ga4-flattened-table) and the [Search Console tables](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/data-sources/gsc/wwwgovuk/#gov-uk-search-console) in Big Query.
- Consider setting up a [Looker Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/), connected to the GA4 data source. While that's an extra thing to learn and set up, it is often a quicker and easier way to extract data from GA4.
- The Explorations area is arguably the most useful area of the GA4 interface. It allows you to customise the metrics and dimensions you want and analyse funnels and user paths. 
- Watch out for sampling and the effects of [high cardinality](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12226705?hl=en). By default G4 gives ‘Faster results’, but there is often an option to get upsampled ‘More detailed results’.

**Rules**

- We regularly review account access data. If you do not access your account for over six months, your access may be removed without notice. There is more information [here](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/processes/ga-access/#monitoring-and-reporting).
- Do not connect Google Analytics data to unauthorised 3rd party tools or APIs. If unsure contact the [GA4 team](mailto:govuk-ga4-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).
