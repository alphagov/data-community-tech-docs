# GOV.UK GA access

Google Analytics (GA) is not designed for collecting personally identifiable information (PII), and collecting PII is against GA terms and conditions. 

If you notice PII in GA, please raise a Zendesk ticket as quickly as possible.

## What we provide access to
Users are able to request access to:

 - Read access to GOV.UK Universal Analytics views 1a and 2
 - Analyst access to the GOV.UK GA4 Production property
 - Read access to GOV.UK GA4 data in BigQuery, [flattened](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/) and [raw](/data-sources/ga/ga4-bq/)
 - Read access to GOV.UK Search Console data in BigQuery

Notice that we only provide read access to BigQuery.
Departments are expected to pay for their own queries via their own Google Cloud Project.

## Who is allowed access
Departments and organisations that publish on www.gov.uk will be allowed access to web analytics.
Access will only be granted to email accounts managed by the department.
Accounts linked to gmail or other non-Civil Service email addresses will not be allowed access.

Every organisation must have an [analytics single point of contact (SPOC)](/processes/spocs/) nominated who raises requests and administers users.

## Monitoring and reporting
Usage of Google Analytics data is monitored by the GOV.UK Analytics team and any suspicious activity flagged.
Reports will be provided to SPOCs showing statistics on the usage of their organisation's users.

Audits will be conducted regularly. Users that have been inactive for 6 months may be removed without warning.

## Request access
The user request process is as follows:

### GDS staff

Requests for access to Google Analytics should be raised by team members themselves, through the 
[GDS Internal IT Support Tool](https://gdshelpdesk.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/helpdesk/WebObjects/Helpdesk.woa). 
It should be raised under "GDS IT Requests" -> "People & Accounts" -> "Google Analytics".

### Other departments / government employees
SPOCs should raise a request via the Analytics Support Form via Sign-On 
[Government Support Form](https://signon.publishing.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in).

Ensure the user has linked their departmental email address with 
[Google](https://accounts.google.com/lifecycle/steps/signup/name?dsh=S-1928776542:1702492718221375&flowEntry=SignUp&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&theme=glif&TL=AHNYTIQQs3IhTlXf196atju3aFJ8jGHmQS5kSgydDsjOlk4Erelk9FUD2RCRv-ix). 

## Using the data
Data must only be used for Civil Service work.
It is OK to authorise tools such as Excel Plugins and Python or R scripts to access GA data 
provided that the system is running on your local machine. 

Data must not be processed via third-party or cloud-based systems.

Google Analytics data itself is management information and not an official statistic. 
The Government Analysis Function has published [guidance on the use of management information](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/national-statisticians-guidance-management-information-and-official-statistics/).
