# GA access

## What we provide access to
We provice access to Universal Analytics for www.gov.uk. We are in the process of defining access to GA4.

## Who is allowed access
Departments and organisations that publish on www.gov.uk will be allowed access to web analytics.
Access will only be granted to email accounts managed by the department, 
for example gmail accounts will not be allowed access.

Must have an analytics single point of contact (SPOC) nominated who raises requests.

Access to Google Analytics is monitored. Inactive accounts will be removed and any suspicious activity flagged.
Reports are be provided to SPOCs showing usage of their users.
