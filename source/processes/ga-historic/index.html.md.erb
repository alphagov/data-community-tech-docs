# Historic GA data

Historic Google Analytics data is stored for a number of agreed GDS Universal Analytics properties.
An inexhaustive list of these properties can be found on the [historic UA data sources page](/data-sources/ga/historic-ua/#content).
This includes the [Universal Analytics data for www.gov.uk](/data-sources/ga/ua/).

## What we provide access to
Users are able to request access to:

- Read access to the historic UA data in BigQuery, including any flattened/processed tables where available

Departments are expected to pay for their queries via their own Google Cloud Project.

For GDS staff, we have built a [Looker Studio report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/833939e2-2cfb-4ed3-a202-90498bf9daff/page/p_fg5xyapmid) which contains similar tables to some of the most frequently used reports in the UA interface.
We are investigating ways to share reports with other public servants.

## Access
To be granted access to this data, please contact the [GA4 support inbox](mailto:govuk-ga4-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk), specifying which dataset you are interested in.

Notice that we only provide read (data viewer) access to BigQuery.
