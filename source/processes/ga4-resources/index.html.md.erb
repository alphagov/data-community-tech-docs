# GA4 Resources
<span style="color:red">**This page is a draft policy**</span>.
This document is here to help users of www.gov.uk GA4 data get to grips with the new interface and data structure.

## FAQs

### What do I need to do about this?

Familiarise yourself with the new data!

GA4 has a new interface, so if you usually use the interface to find out things about your users you will need to re-learn how to use the interface.

We have also significantly redesigned and updated our tracking code to make the data we collect more logical and consistent. This does mean that many events and dimensions have changed.

Any tools or dashboards (for example, Looker Studio reports) you have that currently use UA data will need to be migrated to use the new data. 

### How do I access the data?

If you previously had access to the UA data, you should now be able to access the GA4 data here: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?pli=1#/p330577055/reports/intelligenthome. If you did not previously have access, you can follow the GOV.UK GA access process to request access. 

### How can I get access? How can I request access for my colleague?

Follow the GOV.UK GA access process to request GA4 data access.

At the moment, users must belong to departments that publish on GOV.UK and have Analytics SPOCs to be granted access. If your department publishes on GOV.UK but does not have a SPOC, you can nominate one via the Signon Analytics Support Form.

### Will GDS be providing any GA4 training or resources?


Unfortunately, we do not currently have the capacity to provide training to departments on the use of GA4 data.

We will be sharing resources and helping people with issues where we can via Basecamp, and would encourage people to ask questions so that we can share our knowledge of how to get the best out of GA4 and the GOV.UK GA4 data.

We would encourage you to spend some time familiarising yourself with the data and learning how to use it, as it is quite different from the previous Universal Analytics data. 

### Are there any online training courses you can recommend?

Some online training may be helpful to understand the GA4 interface and core GA4 concepts, but GA4 is more customisable than Universal Analytics, so it is likely that most online resources will not be terribly helpful to those trying to understand GOV.UK-specific data.  
What are the major differences between UA and GA4?

GA4 has a new interface and data structure, and we have taken this opportunity to redesign our tracking to make our data more logical and consistent. This does mean that many events, dimensions and metrics have changed.

### What are the differences between UA and GA4 data?

There are quite a lot of differences between UA and GA4 data - too many to quickly sum up.

For example, one big difference is the change to the definition of a session. This change has a knock-on effect on all sessionised dimensons and metrics, so you should expect differences in the numbers returned for all of these metrics.

But it includes a section on customising reports which only users with admin or edit permissions can do, and which is therefore not relevant to general users.

Lively slightly opinionated quick tour. Probably a bit too focused on ecommerce, demographics and other data we donâ€™t use
