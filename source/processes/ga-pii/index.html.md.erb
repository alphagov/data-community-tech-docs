# PII process (Google Analytics data)

Personally Identifable Information (PII) is data that could potentially identify a specific individual.

We apply redaction to try to ensure that we do not collect any PII into Google Analytics.
Details of the redaction applied can be found on [data source pages](/data-sources/).
For example, for our [GOV.UK GA4 data](/data-sources/ga/ga4/#data-processing-and-modification), we apply redaction in both the dataLayer and Google Tag Manager. 
However, it is still possible that some unwanted data slips through on occasion.
    
If you notice any PII in GDS-owned GA4 data, please raise a Zendesk ticket as quickly as possible, or contact the [GOV.UK Insights and Analytics team](mailto:govuk-ga4-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## Process
When PII is reported or observed, analysts in the GOV.UK Insights and Analytics team will:

 - Confirm whether the data identified is Personally Identifable Information 
 - Ascertain how long and why this data has been collected
 - Report it to our Data Protection & Privacy Specialist
 - [Delete the data](/processes/ga-deletion/), if appropriate
 - Write an [incident report](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/incident-reports.html), if appropriate
