# PII process (Google Analytics data)

Personally Identifable Information (PII) is data that could potentially identify a specific individual.

We [apply redaction](/data-sources/ga/ga4/#data-processing-and-modification) to try to ensure that we do not collect any PII into Google Analytics, but it is still possible that some slips through on occasion.
    
If you notice any PII in GOV.UK GA4, please raise a Zendesk ticket as quickly as possible.

## Process
The Analytics team will:

 - Confirm whether the data identified is Personally Identifable Information 
 - Ascertain how long and why this data has been collected
 - Report it to our Data Protection & Privacy Specialist
 - [Delete the data](/processes/ga-deletion/), if appropriate
 - Write an [incident report](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/incident-reports.html), if appropriate
