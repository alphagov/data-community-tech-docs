# GOV.UK GA4 (BigQuery) backfill processes

Each morning we receive yesterday's [GOV.UK GA4](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) data in [BigQuery](/tools/google-cloud-platform/bigquery/). 

The sending of this raw data is administered by Google, and on occasion the data can arrive relatively late in the day.
When this happens, several processes we use to transform the data fail, and the transformed data needs to be backfilled when it does arrive.

This page aims to summarise the backfilling processes undertaken by the GOV.UK Insights and Analytics team when GOV.UK GA4 data arrives late.

## Partitioned tables

The two partitioned tables built from GOV.UK GA4 data have been set up to automatically backfill, even if the raw data arrives late.

If previously processed data is incorrect and needs to be reprocessed, all that is required is for the partitions (days) including data requiring re-processing to be deleted.
The backfill will then run automatically to reprocess the missing dates. 
If a large number of days need to be reprocessed, the cron schedule of the workflow in Dataform can be adjusted to that it runs more frequently and so that more days are processed in a set time.

More information on how these tables are generated can be read on the [GOV.UK GA4 BigQuery data processing page](/processes/ga4-data-processing/), and the queries used can be [viewed in Github](https://github.com/alphagov/ga4-dataform/branches).

## Pogo-sticking dashboard

The data for the [pogo-sticking dashboard](https://docs.data-community.publishing.service.gov.uk/analysis/pogostick/main/) relies on the flattened GOV.UK GA4 data arriving on time. If this is late, then it will need to be backfilled. Only steps 8, 9 and 10 need to be backfilled for the dashboard to function.

The process for backfilling the data for this dashboard is as follows:

- First, delete the affected empty tables from steps 8, 9 and 10 in the `gds-bq-data.GA4_PogoSticking` dataset
- Run the below queries (changing to the correct date at the beginning) and save the results with the correct table names to their corresponding tables in the aforementioned dataset. For example, if you were backfilling the data for step 9 for the 2nd of September 2024, you would run the backfill query and save the results to the 'gds-bq-data' project, the 'GA4_PogoSticking' dataset, and your table name would be 'PogoStickStepNine_20240902'
