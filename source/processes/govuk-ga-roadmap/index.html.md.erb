# GOV.UK GA4 improvements roadmap
This page details upcoming and recent changes to the [GOV.UK GA4 data collection](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) and [processing](/processes/ga4-data-processing/).

## What we're working on now
### Fixing issues with taxonomy dimensions in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Renaming taxonomy dimensions in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset to ensure the correct page taxonomy information is readily available.

### Fixing issues with search_term and ui_text in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Fixing issues with string fields such as the search_term and ui_text in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset to ensure the all of the data available in the nested fields is being correctly flattened.

### Updating calculated URL fields in GOV.UK GA4 datasets
Reassessing and updating calculated page location, page path, and/or URL fields in GOV.UK GA4 datasets following the [implementation of the canonical URL](/processes/govuk-ga-roadmap/#new-canonical-url-field).

### Improving our backfilling processes 
Improving our backfilling processes, focussing on developing a process for backfilling individual columns of the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/).

### Updating our Smokey test data filter 
Updating a data filter set up in the GOV.UK GA4 property to more accurately label [Smokey test](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/testing.html#smokey) data.

## Recently released
### New canonical URL field
A page's canonical URL is captured in a new field/custom dimension sent with all events.
This is available in the GOV.UK GA4 property, the Data API, and in BigQuery in both the raw and flattened datasets.

### traffic_type parameter added to the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
The traffic_type parameter is available in the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/) to support analysis of GOV.UK GA4 data filters.

## Updates
As we’re still at an early stage, our plans may shift.
We’ll update this page when this happens and add more detail when we can.
