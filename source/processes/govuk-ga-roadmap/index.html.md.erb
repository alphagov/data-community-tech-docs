# GOV.UK GA4 improvements roadmap
This page details upcoming and recent changes to the [GOV.UK GA4 data collection](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) and [processing](/processes/ga4-data-processing/).

See the [changelog](/processes/govuk-ga-roadmap/ga-changelog/) for previous releases.

## What we're working on now

### Improving the GOV.UK GA4 flattening pipeline
Developing the pipeline, splitting the current flattening code into multiple stages to improve debugging and enable more advanced calculations to be carried out during the data processing.

### Deleting PII found in the GOV.UK GA4 dataset
Deleting PII found in the GOV.UK GA4 dataset in our routine checks.

## Recently released

### Backfilled the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
We have refreshed the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset for September so that the [changes to the calculation of the cleaned_page_location](/processes/govuk-ga-roadmap/ga-changelog/#january-2025) now apply since the canonical_url changes were made at the beginning of September.

### Removed our redaction of phone numbers in search terms 
We appreciated that previous attempted to redact this information did not function as we had hoped, and so have removed this redaction.

### MVP guidance on UTM parameter usage written up
We have written up and published basic guidance on [UTM parameter usage](/processes/utm-usage/).

## Updates
We regularly review our priorities and our plans may shift.
We’ll update this page when this happens and add more detail when we can.
