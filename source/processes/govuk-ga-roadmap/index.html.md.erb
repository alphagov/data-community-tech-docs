# GOV.UK GA4 improvements roadmap
This page details upcoming and recent changes to the [GOV.UK GA4 data collection](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) and [processing](/processes/ga4-data-processing/).

## What we're working on now
### Fixing issues with taxonomy dimensions in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Renaming taxonomy dimensions in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset to ensure the correct page taxonomy information is readily available.

### Updating calculated URL fields in GOV.UK GA4 datasets
Reassessing and updating calculated page location, page path, and/or URL fields in GOV.UK GA4 datasets following the [implementation of the canonical URL](/processes/govuk-ga-roadmap/#new-canonical-url-field).

### Improving our backfilling processes 
Improving our backfilling processes, focussing on developing a process for backfilling individual columns of the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/).

### Updating our Smokey test data filter 
Updating a data filter set up in the GOV.UK GA4 property to more accurately label [Smokey test](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/testing.html#smokey) data.

## Recently released
### New canonical URL field
A page's canonical URL is captured in a new field/custom dimension sent with all events.
This is available in the GOV.UK GA4 property, the Data API, and in BigQuery in both the raw and flattened datasets.

### traffic_type parameter added to the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
The traffic_type parameter is available in the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/) to support analysis of GOV.UK GA4 data filters.

### Resolved issues with some custom dimension fields in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Issues with the query_string, ui_text, response, search_term, autocomplete_input, autocomplete_suggestions, and link_text fields in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset have been resolved in the data processing going forwards.
The processing for these fields was only including string values, but we observed that some data was coming through as having an integer or double data type.
We have now edited the processing so that integer and double type data will be included in these fields in the flattened table.

Note that these fields have not yet been backfilled (an upcoming task), so historic flattened data will still only include the string values.

## Updates
As we’re still at an early stage, our plans may shift.
We’ll update this page when this happens and add more detail when we can.
