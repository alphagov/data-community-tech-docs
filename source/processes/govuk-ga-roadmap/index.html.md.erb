# GOV.UK GA4 improvements roadmap
This page details upcoming and recent changes to the [GOV.UK GA4 data collection](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) and [processing](/processes/ga4-data-processing/).

See the [changelog](/processes/govuk-ga-roadmap/ga-changelog/) for previous releases.

## What we're working on now
### Updating calculated URL fields in GOV.UK GA4 datasets
Reassessing and updating calculated page location, page path, and/or URL fields in GOV.UK GA4 datasets following the [implementation of the canonical URL](/processes/govuk-ga-roadmap/#new-canonical-url-field).

### Improving our backfilling processes 
Improving our backfilling processes, focussing on developing a process for backfilling individual columns of the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/).

### Updating our Smokey test data filter 
Updating a data filter set up in the GOV.UK GA4 property to more accurately label [Smokey test](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/testing.html#smokey) data.

### Enabling easier access to site search data
Creating simplified tables or views containing site search data in BigQuery.

### Creating useful tables joining GOV.UK GA4 and Knowledge Graph data
Creating summarised tables or views combining GOV.UK GA4 and [Knowledge Graph](/tools/govgraph/) data.

## Recently released
### New canonical URL field
A page's canonical URL is captured in a new field/custom dimension sent with all events.
This is available in the GOV.UK GA4 property, the Data API, and in BigQuery in both the raw and flattened datasets.

### traffic_type parameter added to the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
The traffic_type parameter is available in the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/) to support analysis of GOV.UK GA4 data filters.

### Resolved issues with some custom dimension fields in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Issues with the query_string, ui_text, response, search_term, autocomplete_input, autocomplete_suggestions, and link_text fields in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset have been resolved in the data processing going forwards.
The processing for these fields was only including string values, but we observed that some data was coming through as having an integer or double data type.
We have now edited the processing so that integer and double type data will be included in these fields in the flattened table.

Note that these fields have not yet been backfilled (an upcoming task), so historic flattened data will still only include the string values.

### Taxonomy dimensions renamed in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Four taxonomy dimensions have been renamed in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset to help users find the correct fields.
`taxonomy_all_DEPRECATED` has become `taxonomy_all` and `taxonomy_all_ids_DEPRECATED` has become `taxonomy_all_ids`, as these are the fields containing current taxonomy information.
`full_taxonomy` has been renamed `full_taxonomy_DEPRECATED` and `full_taxonomy_ids` has been renamed `full_taxonomy_ids_DEPRECATED` because these fields have not been populated since November 2023.

## Updates
As we’re still at an early stage, our plans may shift.
We’ll update this page when this happens and add more detail when we can.
