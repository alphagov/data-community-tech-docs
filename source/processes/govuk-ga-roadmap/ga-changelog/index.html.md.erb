## January 2025
### New canonical URL field
A page's canonical URL is captured in a new field/custom dimension sent with all events.
This is available in the GOV.UK GA4 property, the Data API, and in BigQuery in both the raw and flattened datasets.

### traffic_type parameter added to the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
The `traffic_type` parameter is available in the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/) to support analysis of GOV.UK GA4 data filters.
