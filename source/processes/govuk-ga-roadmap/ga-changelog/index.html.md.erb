# GOV.UK GA4 improvements changelog
This page details improvements made to the [GOV.UK GA4 data collection](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) and [processing](/processes/ga4-data-processing/) since January 2025.

Upcoming changes can be found on the [improvements roadmap page](/processes/govuk-ga-roadmap/).

For a more long-term history of changes to the GOV.UK GA4 data collection, please see the [GOV.UK GA4 annotations report](/products/govuk-ga4-annotations/).

## January 2025
### New canonical URL field
A page's canonical URL is captured in a new field/custom dimension sent with all events.
This is available in the GOV.UK GA4 property, the Data API, and in BigQuery in both the raw and flattened datasets.

### traffic_type parameter added to the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
The `traffic_type` parameter is available in the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/) to support analysis of GOV.UK GA4 data filters.

### Resolved issues with incomplete data in some custom dimension fields in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Issues with the `query_string`, `ui_text`, `response`, `search_term`, `autocomplete_input`, `autocomplete_suggestions`, and `link_text` fields in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset have been resolved in the data processing going forwards.
The processing for these fields was only including string values, but we observed that some data was coming through as having an integer or double data type.
We have now edited the processing so that integer and double type data are included in these fields in the flattened table.

### Taxonomy dimensions renamed in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Four taxonomy dimensions have been renamed in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset to help users find the correct fields.
`taxonomy_all_DEPRECATED` has become `taxonomy_all` and `taxonomy_all_ids_DEPRECATED` has become `taxonomy_all_ids`, as these are the fields containing current taxonomy information.
`full_taxonomy` has been renamed `full_taxonomy_DEPRECATED` and `full_taxonomy_ids` has been renamed `full_taxonomy_ids_DEPRECATED` because these fields have not been populated since November 2023.

### Smokey test data filter updated with other test IP addresses
The 'Smokey' data filter set up in the GOV.UK GA4 property has been updated with the IP addresses now used for the [E2E tests](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-e2e-tests).
The [GOV.UK GA4 data quality notes](/data-sources/ga/ga4/data-quality/#smokey-and-e2e-tests) contain further details on the potential test bot data being collected and notes on how to filter it out of reports.

## February 2025
### Bug fixed on contact form_complete events
A bug which led to contact type `form_complete` events firing on the completion of other forms across GOV.UK has now been fixed.

### Page path (cleaned_page_location) field updated in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
The `cleaned_page_location` field in the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/) has been updated following the [implementation of the canonical URL](/processes/govuk-ga-roadmap/ga-changelog/#new-canonical-url-field).
The `cleaned_page_location` now defaults to the `canonical_url` value, with the hostname removed, if it is available.
If the `canonical_url` is null, the `cleaned_page_location` is calculated as before - by stripping the hostname, anchors and query string from the `page_location`.

### Alternative methods of backfilling datasets investigated 
We have investigated changing our backfilling processes, focussing on developing a process for backfilling individual columns of the [GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset](/data-sources/ga/ga4-flat/).
In this investigation, we learned how to backfill individual columns, but also that this was a fiddly and expensive task. 
We will only use this single column method on rare occasions, and will instead continue to prefer whole day backfilling, with human intervention required to delete the days needing to be backfilled.

### Assets domain Search Console BigQuery export set up
We have set up the bulk export for the [assets.publishing.service.gov.uk domain Search Console property](/data-sources/gsc/assetspublishing/).
This should facilitate analysis of users' journeys to files on that domain.

## March 2025
### Redaction added to target National Insurance numbers
Some users were spotted searching for their National Insurance numbers.
We have added in additional redaction to ensure this data does not get collected in any search analytics data collection, and are deleting any collected National Insurance numbers that may have previously slipped through.

## April 2025
### Changed processing of the content_language field in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
We have noticed unexpected values appearing in the `content_language` field - for example, where the language changes between events on the same page, or multiple times in one user's session.
Previously, we were applying some processing to the `content_language` field to keep one consistent value across one user's events on a given page, but we are no longer sure if that is the best approach and so we have removed this calculation.
The values in the field now simply reflect the values collected with each event, to help us debug these unexpected values.

### Updated processing of the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset to use the custom timestamp
We have added the custom `timestamp` field to window functions previously only using the `event_timestamp`.
From the dates we tested this change with, we do not expect this to cause any difference in the values output - this is just being added as a fail-safe.

### Resolved issues with some sessionised custom dimension fields in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset
Issues were identified with fields which use window functions to generate session-scoped values in the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset.
The processing for the affected fields involved window functions which generated the output values based on the client ID, session ID and (in some cases) page location.
However, in these functions, the `ga_session_id` was not being correctly selected (the string value was being extracted instead of the integer value), and so data could be incorrect for users who had multiple sesssions in one day.
This impacted the `content_language`, `session_source`, `session_medium`, `public_updated_at`, `updated_at`, `content_id`, `browse_topic`, `publishing_app`, `first_published_at`, `taxonomy_all_ids`, `status_code`, `withdrawn`, `document_type`, `history`, `taxonomy_main_id`, `taxonomy_all`, `taxonomy_main`, `taxonomy_level_1`, `full_taxonomy_DEPRECATED`, `full_taxonomy_ids_DEPRECATED`, `rendering_app`, `organisations`, `schema_name`, `term`, `content`, and `campaign_id` fields.
In most cases the difference noticed when fixing the functions was minor (<0.05%), but `session_source` and `session_medium` were more significantly impacted (about 8% out).
We have now edited the processing to fix these fields in the flattened table.

## April 2025
### GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset refreshed
We have refreshed the entirety of the GOV.UK GA4 flattened dataset so that all processing improvements made over previous months are applied to the whole dataset.
