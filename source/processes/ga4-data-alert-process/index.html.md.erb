# GOV.UK GA4 data alert processes

There are a number of ways we monitor the quality and integrity of the GOV.UK GA4 data.
These include basic alerts which tell us whether or not yesterdayâ€™s data has arrived and has been processed in BigQuery, as well as a number of data quality dashboards.

Some of these alerts are detailed on the below pages:

- [BigQuery email alerts](/bigquery-email-alerts/)
- [Looker Studio alerts](/looker-studio-alerts/)
