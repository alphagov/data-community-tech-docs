# GOV.UK GA4 data alert processes

There are a number of ways we monitor the quality and integrity of the GOV.UK GA4 data.
These include basic alerts which tell us whether or not yesterday’s data has arrived and has been processed in BigQuery, as well as a number of data quality dashboards.

Some of these alerts are detailed on the below pages:

- [BigQuery email alerts](/bigquery-email-alerts/)
- [Looker Studio alerts](/looker-studio-alerts/)
