# Google Tag Manager
Google Tag Manager (GTM) is used on www.gov.uk to send data to [Google Analytics 4](/data-sources/ga/ga4/).

The deployment and administration of GTM is owned by the [GOV.UK Analytics team](/teams/analytics/).

See [the GTM change process](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/gtm-change-process.html) for details on the process for making changes in GTM.

## Access
Read access is granted to Performance Analysts to allow for debugging and checking analytics data.

Edit access is limited to those who need it for development and debugging.
This will be Performance Analysts in the Analytics team.

Publish access is limited to developers activily working on Analytics and those who cover support, as well as certain Performance Analysts in the Analytics team.
