# UTM usage

This page suggests how government organisations should use Google Analytics tracking parameters when deploying campaigns that promote web content.
This includes paid-for campaigns like paid search, email marketing and social media activity.

## Why should you use UTMs?

Campaign tagging involves adding tags to the URLs used in the promotions with Google Analytics (GA) standard tracking parameters such as `utm_campaign` and `utm_source`. 

GA will use these parameters when trying to understand the attribution of a given session or event, displaying them in the interface.
Metrics around activity, behaviour and conversions can then be attributed to those tags.

These parameters overwrite Google's default attribution calculations, so should be used carefully and only when required.

Other, non-Google, tracking schema are available, but GA will not treat them in the same way and these alternative URLs could interfere with our standard page tracking.

**Note that campaign tagging should not be used on internal links within GOV.UK.**
This will break the default attribution tracking.

## Tagging schema

Some standardisation in tagging schemas helps make the data in GA more usable and mitigates against [high cardinality](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/13331684).
In our GOV.UK data you can see many examples of missing or duplicate campaign parameters, and other examples where over-complex or partial tagging has made the subsequent analysis more complex.

Google provides a [URL builder for campaigns](https://ga-dev-tools.google/campaign-url-builder/).

### General rules

- Do not use spaces or special characters in the parameters. Underscores are fine, as are hyphens; though we've been caught out in the past by stray en-dashes, em-dashes and smart quotes, so be careful using these symbols
- Use lowercase. Parameters are case sensitive; we must stick to exactly these formats or they will be reported on separately

#### utm_campaign

The utm_campaign provides the name of the campaign being run.
This should be consistent across all campaign elements (whether paid-for, free or earned etc).

#### utm_medium

The utm_medium indicates the channel this link was shared on, which should be similar to the standard GA 'medium' dimension values.

Common examples include:

- utm_medium=organic - non-paid links from search engines
- utm_medium=referral - links on other websites
- utm_medium=social - tweets and posts on owned/earned social media channels
- utm_medium=cpc - digital paid search
- utm_medium=cre - content recommendation engines 
- utm_medium=email - links in emails
- utm_medium=affiliate - partnership promotions 

#### utm_source

The source of the traffic, which should be similar to the standard GA 'source' dimension values.

Common examples might include:

- utm_source=google
- utm_source=facebook
- utm_source=april_newsletter

#### utm_content

We’ve used utm_content for various, and sometimes mixed purposes, covering creative variation, ad format/position, and audience.

For example:

- utm_content=creative1
- utm_content=creative2_320x50
- utm_content=creative3_970x250_hard-working-families
- utm_content=tweet52
- utm_content=post_130515

#### utm_term

Paid search will use this parameter to indicate the search term and the level of match.
This should be done automatically.
