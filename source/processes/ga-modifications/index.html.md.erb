# Modifying GOV.UK GA4 data

It is possible to modify the [GOV.UK GA4 data](/data-sources/ga/ga4/) within the GA4 interface.

## Key events

Key events are set up within the interface.

## GA4 event modifications

Event modifications can be set up within the GA4 interface.

This feature will only be used when there is no sensible way for developers to implement the same change to event tracking.

All regex used in GA4 event modifications should be audited by developers to ensure it will not worsen page load times.
This is because there is a risk that complicated regex used might be slowing down the user's experience, as it is the user's computer which is doing the calculation.
