# GOV.UK GA4 tracking change process
<span style="color:red">**This page is a draft policy**</span>.

Over time, we will need to change or update the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tracking in place on www.gov.uk.

## Tracking change process
Changes to the GA4 will follow this process:
 - Tracking changes requested
 - Need for and value of requested changes evaluated by the Analytics team 
 - Schema for proposed changes drawn up by the Analytics team and those requesting the changes
 - Changes implemented and tested by developers
 - Changes tested by Analytics team analytsts
 - Changes deployed by Analytics team

Changes that require updates to the [Google Tag Manager](/processes/gtm/) container will follow the [GTM change process](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/gtm-change-process.html). 

### Reasons for tracking changes
The Analytics team will evaluate the need for and value of any requested changes to ensure GA4 data collection is of a high quality and value for money.

The team will ensure there is an adequate need for any changes, such as:
- there is a data user need for data on a GOV.UK component or feature that is currently not being tracked
- a component or feature has changed and the pre-existing GA4 tracking has broken or is no longer fit for purpose

The Analytics team will also ensure GA4 tracking is efficient and value-for-money, considering factors such as:
- the number of hits that would be sent by any proposed tracking
- whether specific tracking is needed on a given feature, or if the same information can be learned from other, pre-existing tracking
- how many people are likely to use this data

#### Scroll tracking changes

Scroll tracking data reveals the approximate page depth users scroll down to.
This tracking necessarily fires a high number of hits, and so is only used on a limited number of pages and for a short duration to reduce costs.

When requesting scroll tracking changes, the data user should detail:
- what pages they would like scroll tracking on
- what [type of scroll tracking](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/analytics/event_scroll_tracking.html) would suit their needs
- how long the scroll tracking should be live (what length of time would provide sufficient data)

The Analytics team will evaluate scroll tracking requests to ensure they are appropriate and cost-effective.

### Design of GA4 tracking

New GA4 tracking will be designed to ensure consistency with [existing GOV.UK GA4 events](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/analytics/schema.html).

### Testing of GA4 tracking

New GA4 tracking will be tested to ensure the values returned match the proposed schema drawn up by the Analytics team, and that (as far as can be ascertained) the tracking will function as expected and return quality data across GOV.UK.


## Tracking monitoring
The Analyics team monitors and maintains the GOV.UK GA4 data. Tracking may be removed if it is believed to be of low utility, high cost, or if the quality of the data generated is poor.
