# Analytics team

The GOV.UK Data Analytics team, known as the Analytics team, is a small team within the Data Services group in the GOV.UK directorate in GDS.

The team is primarily working on the migration of GOV.UK from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4.

## Contacting the team

For other GDS staff, the best way to contact the team is either using the #govuk-ga4 Slack channel or the team's #analytics-team channel.

For other public servants, the team can be contacted via their [GA4 support inbox](mailto:govuk-ga4-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).
